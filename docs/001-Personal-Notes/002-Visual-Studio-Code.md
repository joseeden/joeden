## Undo and Redo 

Visual studio code follows the same:

```bash
# Undo 
Ctrl + z 

# Redo 
Ctrl + Shift + z
```

## Create nested folders 

Click the folder icon to add a folder.

To add nested folder, type the subsequent folders after "/".

## Collapse all folders

## Hidden Files 

Some hidden files normally start with "." and are excluded from view. You can more excluded files by:

- Click gear icon at the bottom left âš™
- Select Settings
- Search for "exclude" 
- To add more file format, click Add pattern

## Search inside a file 

To search for a particular section of a file or a code, we can use the shortcut below.
This saves time from scrolling over the whole file. This works with code too.

```bash
Ctrl + Shift + P --> @ 
```

## Run/Search for a command

To run a command, we can also use the same, then type the command.

```bash
Ctrl + Shift + P --> > 
```

## Duplicate a line 

To duplicate a line multiple times, click and hold the keys:

```bash
Alt + Shift + Down arrow 
```

## Move a line 

Similar to cutting a line and pasting it somewhere else in the file, we can also use the shortcut below.

```bash
Alt + Up/Down arrow 
```

## Fold sections of a file 

We can hide sections of a file by "folding" them.

```bash
Ctrl + Shift + p 
>fold all 
```

## Multicursor Editing (adding same text to multiple lines)

To type the same text on multiple places simulatenously:

```bash
Alt (hold) 
Use the mouse to click the places to edit
```

![](/img/docs/ide-terminal-multicursor1.png)

Note that in some cases, it could be:

```bash
Ctrl (hold) 
Use the mouse to click the places to edit  
```

## Replace all Occurence 

To replace all occurence of a text in a file (for example, the word), select the particular word and:

```bash
Shift + o 
```

All occurence of the word will be highlighted and will be edited at the same time.

![](/img/docs/ide-terminal-edit-all-occurence.png)

The number of occurence will also appear at the bottom right.

## Linked Editing (for HTML Tags)

To edit the open and closing tag at the same time, we can enable linked editing.

```bash
Ctrl + Shift + p 
>linked editing 
```

## Shortcut for Keyboard Shortcuts 

Open the keyboard shortcuts page for the first time by

```bash
Ctrl + Shift + P
> keyboard shortcuts
```

Then select "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"

![](/img/docs/ide-terminal-keyboardshortcuts.png)

Type "Open keyboard shortcuts". 
For the keybinding, click "CTRL (hold), K, S, enter"

![](/img/docs/ide-terminal-set-ks.png)

The next time you want to see the keyboard shortcuts, just type:

```bash
Ctrl (hold) + k + s" 
```

## Change keyboard shortcuts 

Make sure to follow the step before this to set the shortcut for the keyboard shortcuts page first. To change or set a keyboard shortcut:

```bash
Ctrl (hold) + k + s" 
```

## HTML Trick - Emmet

This syntax assistance is particularly useful for HTML for writing boilerplate code.

To generate a layout, define the keywords/letters followed by "+" sign.
Example:

```bash
article > header+h1+p
press tab  
```
which will generate:

```html
<article></article>
<header></header>
<h1></h1> 
```

To create a numbered list with 10 items:

```bash
ul>li*5
press tab
```

which will generate:

```bash
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul> 
```

## Other Stuff 

- Terminal - VS Code has a built-in terminal. Cons is that some Linux command doesn't work inside the terminal (e.g reverse search)

- Peek definitions/implementations 

- Integration with Git

- Remote repositories 

- Remote SSH 

- Remote containers

- .devcontainer 

- Debugger 

- Debugger: Breakpoint and Logpoint  

- HTTP Client like Thunder Client (for API testing)

- Docker extension 

- VS Code tasks (for repetitive shell commands)

- Snippets
