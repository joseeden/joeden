## Using Google Drive (NOT WORKING)

:::info 

I've tried a lot of workarounds to use static files uploaded in Google Drive but none of it worked.

:::

Google Drive does not allow embedding files in an `iframe` in your `.mdx` file, even if the file is publicly shared. The Google Drive viewer page blocks embedding for security reasons.

```html
import React from "react";

<iframe
  src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/194ILry_ILrOUqMjDxNGE-uqaeA1IBCAA/view"
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc" }}
></iframe>
```

<iframe
  src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/194ILry_ILrOUqMjDxNGE-uqaeA1IBCAA/view"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc" }}
></iframe>


## Using Google Drive Download Link (NOT WORKING)

:::info 

I've tried a lot of workarounds to use static files uploaded in Google Drive but none of it worked.

Instead of the **viewer link**, you can use the **direct download** link format:

```bash
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID
```

Example:

```html
import React from "react";

<iframe
  src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=194ILry_ILrOUqMjDxNGE-uqaeA1IBCAA"
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc" }}
></iframe>
```

## Using Netlify Drop 

Since Google Drive doesnâ€™t allow embedding HTML files, you can use a service that hosts static files and provides direct public URLs. An example is Netlify Drop.

- No need to link a Github/online Git repository 
- Drag and drop your HTML files
- Get a public URL to use in your iframe

To host a static site in Netlify, please see [Hosting Static Sites.](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/003-Developer-Notes/050-Hosting-Static-Sites.md)

Once you have the URL for the site, you can now add it to `src` in your markdown (`.mdx`) page:

```html
import React from "react";

<iframe
  src="https://https://melodic-pika-35d471.netlify.app//"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc" }}
></iframe>
```

The website is now embedded in your markdown page, as seen below. You can hover and test the site functionalities.


<iframe
  src="https://https://melodic-pika-35d471.netlify.app//"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc" }}
></iframe>
