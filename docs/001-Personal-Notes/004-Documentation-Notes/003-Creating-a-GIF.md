## Using ScreentoGif 

Download the portable from here: [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/)
Take note of the location where you put the exe file. IN my case, I put it in my Downloads folder.

```bash
C:\Users\Eden.Jose\Downloads\Installers\ScreenToGif.2.41.Portable.x64 
```

Double-click the exe file to start using it. You should see this:
