## Enable WSL Integration 

If you're using WSL2 in your Windows machine, you need to enable the integration between WSL and Docker Desktop. Open the Docker Desktop console and click the gear icon to open the settings.

Go to **Resources** > **WSL Integration**, and then select the distro. Click **Apply and Restart** afterwards.
