## AWS CLI 

If you've installed AWS CLI before then there is a chance that you're using the version 1. You can do either of the following:

- [Replace version 1 with version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration-instructions.html#cliv2-migration-instructions-migrate) 
- [Install both version side-by-side](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration-instructions.html#cliv2-migration-instructions-migrate)

To install AWS CLI, check out [the official AWS Installation Guide for AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

1. Install AWS CLI. 

    ```bash
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
    unzip awscliv2.zip
    sudo ./aws/install 
    ```

2. Verify AWS CLI installation.

    ```bash
    $ aws --version

    aws-cli/2.19.1 Python/3.12.6 Linux/5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 exe/x86_64.ubuntu.22  
    ```

## AWS SAM CLI 

Reference: [Getting started with AWS Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started.html)

1. Download the [AWS SAM CLI file.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started.html)

2. To copy files from your local computer to the Linux machine, user SCP. Make sure to specify the keypair for the Linux machine.

    ```bash
    scp -i /path/to/key.pem file.txt username@<host-ip>:/tmp/ 
    ```

3. Login to your Linux machine and unzip the AWS SAM file and install.

    ```bash
    unzip aws-sam-cli-linux-x86_64.zip -d sam-installation  
    sudo ./sam-installation/install
    ```

4. Verify installation.

    ```bash
    $ sam --version
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
    SAM CLI, version 1.127.0  
    ```






## Create the Service-linked Role

To [create a service-linked role](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles):

1. Log-in to your AWS Management Console and go to IAM dashboard.
2. in the left menu, click *Roles* > *Create Role*
3. In the *Select trusted entity page*, choose *AWS Service.*
4. In the *Use cases for other AWS services*, type EKS.
5. Select the *EKS (Allow EKS to manage clusters in your behalf)* then click Next > Next
6. In the *Name, review, and create* step, git it a name: EKSServiceRole click *Create role*.

Back at the Roles page, click the role you just created to show the details. Copy the ARN. We'll be using it in the IAM Policy next.

```bash
arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/aws-service-role/eks.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKS 
```


## Keypairs

Refer to the links below.

- [Create a keypair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html)
- [Create a IAM user](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-create-an-administrator-iam-user-and-group-in-aws/)
- [Create an access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)

For the keypair, store it inside `~/.ssh` directory.

For the IAM User and Group, make sure to add the user to the group. Sample values:

- IAM User: k8s-admin
- IAM Group: k8s-lab

:::info[For EKS Labs]

While you can attach the EKSFullAccess policy to your user, you can also give it the *AdministratorAccess*. Once you've created the `k8s-admin`, log-in to the AWS Management Console using this IAM user.

:::

## IAM Policy

The IAM Policy required will differ based on the purpose of the user. Make sure the set the policy with only the required permissions.

For this example, we'll create the **EKSFullAccess** policy that allows us access to EKS and ECR.

1. Go to IAM console.
2. In the left panel, click Policies.
3. Click Create Policy.
4. Choose the JSON tab and paste the [EKSFullAccess](EKSFullAccess.json) policy. 
5. Click Review Policy.
6. Give the policy the name and description.
7. Finally, click Create Policy.


## IAM User

Create a user in IAM and provide it with the necessary permissions. For testing purposes, you can provide it administrator access for now but note that **limited permissions should always be provided to IAM users.**

```
IAM user >  Create user > Enter user name > Next > Next > Create User 
```

You associate the IAM policy directly to the IAM user by choosing **Attach existing policies directly.**

## IAM Group

The IAM Group name may differ based on the purpose of the user.

For EKS Labs: Create the **k8s-lab** group.

1. Go to IAM console.
2. In the left panel, click User Groups.
3. Click Create group
4. Give it a user group name: *k8s-lab*
5. Scroll below to the Attach User section. Choose "k8s-admin" and the current user you're signed in to.
6. Scroll below to the Attach permission policies.
7. Filter and add the following policy.

    - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
    - `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`
    - `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`
    - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
    - `AmazonSNSReadOnlyAccess` (for CloudFormation)
    - `AmazonEKSServicePolicy`
    - `AWSCloudFormationFullAccess`
    <!-- - IAMReadOnlyAccess -->

8. Finally, click Create group.
9. You may add the new user to this group.

**Note**: You may encounter some issue when using this user with limited IAM permissions. As a workaround, you can attach the *AdministratorAccess* to the user.




## Access Keys

Select your user and go to Security credentials and then under Access keys, click **Create access key.** Select CLI for use case and chekc the confirmation statement at the bottom. Click **Next** and then Create **Access key.**

</div>

In the **Retrieve access keys**, click Show to see the secret access key. This is the only time the secreat access key will be shown. Make sure to note it down. Click **Done.**

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/1102-aws-sam-auth-cli-create-access-key-show-secret-access-key.png)

</div>

## Configure your AWS CLI 

Once you have the access keys, you can save them in your AWS CLI by running: 

```bash
aws configure  
```

Enter the access key and secret access key. You can change the region to other AWS regions.

```bash
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA123ABCD45678Z
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ****************************************
Default region name [None]: ap-southeast-1
Default output format [None]: 
```


## Credentials File

In your terminal, configure the `.aws/credentials` file that's automatically created in your home directory. Supply the access key ID and secret access key which you downloaded in the [previous step.](#access-keys)

```bash
vim ~/.aws/credentials 
```

```bash
# /home/user/.aws/credentials

[k8s-admin]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
aws_secret_access_key = ABCDXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
region = ap-southeast-1
output = json
``` 

You can use a different profile name. To use the profile, export it as a variable.

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=k8s-admin
```

To verify, we can run the commands below:

```bash
aws configure list 
```
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity 
```

Although the region is already set in the profile, we'll also be using the region in many of the commands. We can save it as a variable.

```bash
export AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1 
```
