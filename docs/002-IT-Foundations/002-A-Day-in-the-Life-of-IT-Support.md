## Overview 

So, what's the day-to-day work of someone in IT support like? Well, it varies a lot based on whether you're providing in-person or remote support and whether you're working for a small business or a large enterprise company.

And there's really no such thing as day-to-day work since the puzzles and challenges are always new and interesting. But, in general, an IT support specialist makes sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. This includes managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting, and configuring office and computing equipment. This program is designed to prepare you for an entry-level role in IT helpdesk support.

Here are some things that you may learn when you work as an IT Support:

- How to set up a user's desktop or workstation
- How to install the computer applications used by people
- How to fix a problem or troubleshoot when something goes wrong
- How to put practices in place to prevent similar problems from happening again
- The technical aspects of troubleshooting a problem
- How to communicate with users to best assist them.

One of the best parts of IT support is the problem-solving aspect. You'll get to exercise your creativity to spin up a solution to a user's issue.

Being an IT generalist also gives you the flexibility to learn and practice so many different skills and eventually determine where you want to focus your career. Plus, when things go wrong or you fail at something in IT, you can take the feedback from those mistakes and be better equipped to tackle them the next time around. Using failure as feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life.

You'll learn to love the process of problem-solving and constantly stretching yourself to learn and grow. -->
