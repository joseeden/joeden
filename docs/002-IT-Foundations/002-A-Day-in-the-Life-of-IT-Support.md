## Overview

What does the day-to-day work of an IT support specialist look like? The answer varies widely depending on whether you’re providing in-person or remote support and whether you’re working for a small business or a large enterprise.

In IT support, no two days are the same. Each day brings new puzzles and challenges. Generally, an IT support specialist ensures that an organization’s technological equipment runs smoothly. This involves managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting, and configuring office and computing equipment. This program aims to prepare you for an entry-level role in IT helpdesk support.

Here are some skills and knowledge areas you may develop while working in IT support:

- Setting up user desktops or workstations
- Installing computer applications used by staff
- Troubleshooting and resolving technical issues
- Implementing preventive measures to avoid recurring problems
- Understanding the technical details of problem-solving
- Communicating effectively with users to assist them

One of the most rewarding aspects of IT support is problem-solving. You’ll use your creativity to devise solutions to users’ issues.

As an IT generalist, you have the flexibility to learn and practice various skills, helping you determine where to focus your career. When things go wrong or you make mistakes in IT, you can use that feedback to improve and be better prepared for future challenges. Viewing failure as a learning opportunity is valuable both in IT and in life.

You'll learn to appreciate the problem-solving process and continually push yourself to learn and grow.
