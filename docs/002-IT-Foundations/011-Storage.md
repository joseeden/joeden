## Overview 

In addition to RAM, computers use storage devices like **Hard Disk Drives** (HDDs) or **Solid State Drives** (SSDs) to store data persistently. HDDs use spinning disks to read and write data, while SSDs use flash memory for faster performance and greater durability. The storage device holds the operating system, applications, and user data, retaining information even when the computer is turned off.
