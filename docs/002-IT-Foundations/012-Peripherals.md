## Overview 

Peripherals are external devices that connect to the computer to extend its functionality. Common peripherals include:

- **Input Devices**: Keyboards, mice, and webcams.
- **Output Devices**: Monitors, printers, and speakers.
- **Storage Devices**: External hard drives and USB flash drives.

These peripherals communicate with the computer through various ports and interfaces, allowing users to interact with the system and access additional features.


### USB

**USB (Universal Serial Bus)** devices are the most common connections for our gadgets. USB has evolved significantly since its inception:

- **USB 2.0:** Transfer speeds of 480 megabits per second.
- **USB 3.0:** Transfer speeds of 5 gigabits per second.
- **USB 3.1:** Transfer speeds of 10 gigabits per second.

It's important to note the difference between units. **Mb/s** (megabits per second) is a measure of data transfer rate, while **MB** (megabytes) is a unit of data storage. One byte equals 8 bits, so to transfer 1 megabyte of data in a second, you need an 8 megabits per second connection. For example, transferring 40 megabytes of data per second requires a 320 megabits per second connection.

Your USB ports also need to match the device capabilities to achieve maximum transfer speeds. Plugging a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 port won't give you 3.0 speeds, but the device will still work because USB is backward compatible. Generally, USB 2.0 ports are black, USB 3.0 ports are blue, and USB 3.1 ports are teal, though this may vary by manufacturer. The latest USB connector is **Type-C**, designed to replace many peripheral connections.

### Displays

In addition to USB peripherals, display peripherals are essential to understand. Common input standards include:

- **DVI (Digital Visual Interface):** Primarily outputs video.
- **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):** Outputs both video and audio, and is common in modern televisions and computers.
- **DisplayPort:** Also outputs both video and audio, becoming increasingly popular.

### Projectors

Projectors are useful for sharing information with a group in the same location. They function similarly to other display devices and can experience similar issues like dead pixels or image burn-in.

### Connectors and Cables

Connecting a computer to a projector involves using a display cable like VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort. The computer's operating system will detect the new display, allowing it to be extended or mirrored like a second monitor:

- [MacOS - How to connect a display, TV, or projector to Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl5fdd37ce/mac)
- [Ubuntu - How to connect another monitor to your computer](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/display-dual-monitors.html)

Frequent connections and disconnections can wear out or damage projector cables and connectors, so check these first if the display flickers or disappears.

### Device Driver

If your computer doesn't recognize the projector's display resolution, it may default to a low resolution like 640x480 or 1024x768. In this case, you may need a device driver from the projector manufacturer's support website.

### Lighting

Projectors often use bright, hot incandescent bulbs, which can cause overheating. If a projector gets too hot, it will shut down to protect the lamp. LED projectors are becoming more common, as they have fewer overheating issues and longer lifespans than incandescent bulbs.

### Calibration

Projectors may need calibration when first installed, reset, or moved. Calibration adjusts the image for distance and angle, ensuring it's square and aligned with the projection surface. This involves focusing the image and making geometric adjustments. Refer to the projector's vendor documentation for specific calibration instructions.
