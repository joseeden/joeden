## Overview 

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and the internet.

- Allows clients to make requests to servers while hiding their IP addresses.
- Receives client requests, forwards them to the server, and returns server responses.
- Cache content to improve load times and reduce bandwidth usage.
- Filter web traffic to enforce organizational policies.
- Implement user authentication protocols and secure tunnels

## Types of Proxy

### Circuit Level Proxy

A Circuit Level Proxy establishes and manages connections between networks, focusing on the session rather than individual packets.

  - Like a SOCKS firewall
  - Operate at Layer 5 (Session layer)

### Application Level Proxy

An Application Level Proxy filters traffic based on the specific applications being used, offering detailed control over data exchanges.

  - Deeper packet inspection
  - Conducts various proxy functions for each type of application
  - Best positioned inside the network, as closely as possible to the application server

### Kernel Proxy

A Kernel Proxy efficiently processes and filters traffic at a deep level, suitable for high-speed environments.

  - Known as a "5th Generation Firewall"
  - Minimal impact on network performance but thoroughly inspects packets across all layers
  - Uses the operating system's kernel to process and filter packets
  - Often used in high-throughput environments requiring granular control and speed
  - Best positioned as close as possible to the application server


## Functionality

### Forward Proxy

A **forward proxy** acts as an intermediary that sits between clients and the external servers. It forwards client requests to the internet and returns the server's response to the client.

- Hides IP address of internal client station.
- After internet content is fetched, the content can be cached on the proxy.
- Cached content speeds up subsequent requests.

Direction:

```bash
Client -> Forward Proxy -> Internet -> Server 
```

### Reverse Proxy

A **reverse proxy** sits in front of one or more servers and forwards client requests to the appropriate server. The client interacts with the reverse proxy as if it were the server.

- Protecting the servers, not the client devices, thereby hiding the identity of the server.
- Proxy server is configured with a public IP address and a port number.
- Can support loadbalancing and SSL/TLS offloading or termination.

Direction:

```bash
Client -> Reverse Proxy -> Internal Network -> Server(s) 
```

### Transparent Proxy

A **transparent proxy**, also known as an intercepting proxy, inline proxy, or forced proxy, is a type of forward proxy that intercepts and redirects client requests without requiring any client-side configuration or awareness. 

- Internal clients point to proxy server's IP address as their default gateway.
- You can have proxy configurations on an actual router or server.
