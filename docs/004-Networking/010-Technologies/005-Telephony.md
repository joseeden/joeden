## Telephony

Telephony refers to the technology that allows for voice communication over distances. It includes traditional landline systems, mobile networks, and modern digital methods like VoIP.

- Traditional telephony used circuit-switched networks/
- Evolved from analog to digital, now including mobile networks.
- Features include voicemail, conferencing, and call forwarding.
- Integration with digital and mobile systems.

## VOIP

VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) enables voice communication over data networks, replacing traditional phone lines by leveraging internet protocols.

- Carries voice communication over data networks 
- Converts voice from analog to digital form
- Transmits signals using the Internet Protocol

## VOIP Devices

VoIP devices enable voice communication over IP networks, replacing traditional telephone hardware.

- VoIP phones

   - Look similar to traditional phones but connect directly to data networks.
   - Convert voice into data packets for transmission over IP.

- Softphones

   - Software-based solutions that enable VoIP calls on computers or mobile devices.

## VOIP Security

Ensuring the security of VoIP communications is essential to preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

- Encryption

   - Protects VoIP traffic by scrambling the data to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Can impact voice quality due to increased processing requirements.

- VLAN segmentation

   - Separates VoIP traffic from other network traffic using Virtual LANs (VLANs).
   - Helps protect voice communication and improves network performance.

- Firewalls and intrusion detection

   - Firewalls block unauthorized access to the VoIP network.
   - Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor for suspicious activity and security threats.
