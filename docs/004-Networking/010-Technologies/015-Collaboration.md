At the same time, SMS provided a popular means to use the cellular network for text, picture, and video messaging. Also known as "text messaging", it is a convenient way of sending a text message to any telephone number but it has some significant security flaws: 

- Messages sent via SMS are not encrypted; vulnerable to eavesdropping 
- SMS doesn't provide any type of strong authentication
- SMS is easy to spoof the identity of the sender
