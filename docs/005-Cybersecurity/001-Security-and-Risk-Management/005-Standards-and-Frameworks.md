- Includes the **Privacy Rule for patient rights** and the **Security Rule for data protection safeguards**.
- Violating HIPAA can lead to severe penalties, including fines and criminal charges.


### PCI DSS 

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. PCI DSS was developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect cardholder data and reduce credit card fraud.

- Applies to any organization handling, processing, or storing cardholder information.
- Requires measures like encryption, access controls, and security assessments to prevent data breaches.
- Non-compliance can lead to fines, penalties, or loss of the right to process card payments.
