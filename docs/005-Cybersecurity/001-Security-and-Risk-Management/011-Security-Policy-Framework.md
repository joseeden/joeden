  - Implement controls to mitigate identified risks.
  - Regularly review and update risk assessments to address new threats.

- **Access Control**
  - Define who can access information and under what conditions.
  - Implement mechanisms to authenticate and authorize users.
  - Monitor and log access to critical systems and data.

- **Incident Response**
  - Establish procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents.
  - Designate an incident response team with defined roles and responsibilities.
  - Conduct regular training and simulations to ensure preparedness.

- **Compliance and Audit**
