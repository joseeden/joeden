## CIS

Center for Internet Security (CIS) is known for its CIS Controls, a set of prioritized security practices to mitigate common cyber threats.

- Provides benchmarks and guidelines for securing various technologies, including operating systems and software.
- Offers resources like risk assessments and training to help organizations strengthen their cybersecurity.

## NIST RMF/CSF

The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) manages cybersecurity risks for federal systems, including categorization and security control selection.

- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary guideline with five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
- RMF emphasizes risk assessment, control implementation, and continuous monitoring for federal compliance.
- CSF provides flexible cybersecurity practices, adaptable to various industries and sectors.

## ISO/IEC

ISO/IEC refers to standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

- Establish best practices and frameworks for technology, information security, and related fields.
- **ISO/IEC 27001** - Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), providing a framework to protect sensitive information.

## SSAE SOC 2  

SSAE SOC 2 (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements) is an auditing standard designed for service organizations to assess their data security practices.

- "Trust Services Criteria" of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- The audit evaluates whether a service organizationâ€™s controls and processes meet these criteria, providing assurance to clients and stakeholders.
- A **SOC 2 report** is often required in industries with sensitive data handling to demonstrate strong data security and compliance.
- Financial statement integrity
- Internal controls; Type I and Type II

## NIST SP-800 

The NIST Special Publications (SP) 800 series contains cybersecurity guidelines, best practices, and technical standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
- Addresses various cybersecurity topics, such as risk management, data protection, and incident response.
- Publications are used by U.S. federal agencies and widely adopted by private-sector organizations.
- Key documents include:

  - **SP 800-53** for federal security controls and 
  - **SP 800-171** for non-federal handling of controlled unclassified information.
