## Overview

A Virtual Private Network or VPN extends a private network over a public one, allowing secure access to remote networks. This enables users to securely send and receive data.

- Communication tunnel for point-to-point transmission.
- With VPN, users can work from remote or different locations.
- Secures authentication and data traffic over untrusted networks.


## Tunneling Protocols 

Tunneling protocols are important for securing data transmission across networks, especially over the internet. They encapsulate and encrypt data to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication during transmission.

- **IPSec**

  - Secure IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet.
  - Supports two modes: **Transport mode** and **Tunnel mode**.
  - Widely used for establishing secure VPN connections.
  - Operates at the network layer (Layer 3).

- **Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)**

  - Mechanism for establishing a tunnel over an insecure network.
  - Often used with IPSec for secure VPN connections.
  - Combines features of PPTP and L2F.
  - Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2).

- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**

  - Establishes secure connections between browsers and servers.
  - Secures HTTP traffic, forming HTTPS.
  - Operates above the transport layer (Layer 4).
  - No longer used.

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

  - Upgraded, more secure version of SSL.
  - Operates above the transport layer (Layer 4).
  - Used in HTTPS and other secure protocols like FTPS and IMAPS.


## Tunnel Configurations

Both tunnel configurations can be used for site-to-site or client-to-site VPNs.

- **Full Tunnel**

  - All network traffic is routed through the VPN.
  - Ensures all internet activity is monitored and controlled.
  - Maximum security, but slower internet speeds due to traffic routing.
  - Ideal for environments requiring strict security.
  - Most organizations used this by default.

- **Split Tunnel**

  - Only specific traffic is routed through the VPN.
  - Non-critical traffic uses the local internet connection.
  - Improves internet speed by reducing VPN load.
  - Useful for accessing local resources and internet simultaneously.
  - Requires careful configuration to avoid security risks.

## VPN Configurations

VPN configurations ensure secure connections over public networks and come in various forms, including site-to-site, client-to-site, and clientless VPNs. 

- **Site-to-site**
 
  - Requires compatible VPN appliance at each site.
  - Commonly used for linking branch offices to headquarters.
  - Secures traffic, but can slow down users due to extra hops

- **Client-to-site**
 
  - Requires VPN client software on the user's device.
  - Connects individual devices to a remote network.
  - Ideal for remote or mobile workers.
  - Uses strong authentication and encryption methods.

- **Clientless**

  - Provides secure access via a web browser.
  - No need for VPN software installation on client devices.
  - Ideal for temporary or unmanaged devices.
  - Access is typically limited to specific web applications.



## VPN Endpoints

VPNs need an endpoint on the remote network to establish and accept VPN connections. Various devices can function as VPN endpoints.

- **Firewalls**

  - Secure the network by filtering traffic and enforcing VPN connections.
  - Often used as a VPN endpoint for added security.

- **Routers**

  - Direct traffic between networks and can establish VPN connections.
  - Commonly used in small to medium-sized networks as VPN endpoints.

- **Servers**

  - Provide remote access by hosting VPN software or services.
  - Suitable for networks needing dedicated resources for VPN management.

- **VPN Concentrators**

  - Specialized devices designed to manage multiple VPN connections.
  - Ideal for large-scale environments with high VPN traffic.
