## Disaster Recovery in the Real World

Ensure critical systems are formally identified and regularly test backups, as incidents may go undetected for extended periods.

- Complex systems store valuable information across multiple servers.
- Basic disaster recovery involves server-level data backup.
- Considerations for databases and dependencies are vital.
- Data entered into one system is distributed to others in large enterprises.
- Coordination among systems is crucial for maintaining common data.
- Understanding data flow and dependencies is essential for successful disaster recovery.

## Sample Scenario

At a hospital in Los Angeles, it took 260 days (about 8 and a half months) to discover that there was a compromise.

- Time-based malware corrupted the last backup.
- Restoration required going back nearly a year prior to the incident.
- Data was restored piece-by-piece to avoid reinfection.
- Highlights the need for multiple backup levels and retention periods.

## Financial Department is rarely involved

- **Executives** and **Public Relations** staff need to be aware of the company's Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) to properly handle the expectations of the public, as well as of company stakeholders. 

- **IT personnel** should be focused on helping businesses return to normal operations. 

A company's financial department is rarely involved in a disaster recovery plan, except when the issue at hand is directly connected to company finances (see Chapter 2 ISC2 Study Guide, module 3, under Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan).
