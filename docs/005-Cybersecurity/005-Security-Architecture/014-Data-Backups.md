## Considerations

Data Backup involves creating duplicate copies of critical data and storing them off-site. These backups serve as a safeguard in case the primary data becomes unavailable due to a disaster or incident.

- On-premises 
  - Tape 
  - Network-Attached Storage (NAS) 
  - Storage Area Network (SAN)
- Offsite 
  - Cloud
- Frequency
  - Daily 
  - Weekly 
  - Bi-monthly 
  - Monthly
- Compression 
- Encryption 
- Type of Backup
- Virtual Machines  
  - Snapshots 
  - Custom images

## Data Recovery Process 


1. **Selection of Backup**
   - Identify the most recent and relevant backup.
   - Ensure backup integrity and completeness.
   - Choose the appropriate backup type (full, incremental, differential).

2. **Initiating the Recovery Process**
   - Load the backup data onto the recovery system.
   - Follow the recovery protocol for the specific backup software.
   - Monitor the progress to identify any issues early.

3. **Data Validation**
   - Verify the completeness of the recovered data.
   - Check for any corruption or missing files.
   - Compare the restored data with the original backup.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the recovered data in a controlled environment.
   - Ensure all applications and services function correctly.
   - Confirm data integrity and usability.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Record the recovery process steps and outcomes.
   - Document any issues encountered and their resolutions.
   - Generate a comprehensive report for stakeholders.

6. **Notification**
   - Inform relevant parties of the recovery completion.
   - Provide details on the restored data and any discrepancies.
   - Communicate any follow-up actions required.

## Data Backup Types

- **Full Backup**

  - Copies all selected files and data.
  - Provides a complete snapshot at a specific point in time.

- **Incremental Backup**

  - Copies only the data that has changed since the last backup.
  - Efficient in terms of storage space but may require multiple backups for a complete restore.

- **Differential Backup**

  - Copies all the data that has changed since the last full backup.
  - Requires less time for restoration compared to incremental backups.

- **Mirror Backup**

  - Creates an exact copy of the source data.
  - Ensures a one-to-one replica of the original but may not offer versioning.

- **Snapshot Backup**

  - Captures the state of the system or data at a specific point in time.
  - Provides a consistent view for backup purposes without affecting ongoing operations.

- **Cloud Backup**

  - Involves storing data in an offsite cloud environment.
  - Enhances data accessibility and provides a secure offsite backup solution.
