## Intrusion 

An **intrusion** occurs when security mechanisms are bypassed, enabling unauthorized access to an organizationâ€™s resources. 

**Intrusion detection** is a monitoring method that examines recorded information and real-time events to identify abnormal activities indicative of potential incidents or intrusions. 

## Difference between IDS and IPS 

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are both crucial for network security, designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. 

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
  - Logs and alerts when it finds something suspicious or malicious.
  - Automates log inspection and real-time event analysis to detect intrusion attempts.
  - Recognizes anomalies and responds with alerts or alarms.
  - Does not stop an attack, but are programmed to alert based on a criteria.

- **Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)**
  - Logs, alert on it, and take an action when it finds something suspicious or malicious.
  - Can block the traffic or prevent the application from running.
  - Should be placed at the border of the network, behind the firewall.

## Types of IDS/IPS

Both IDS and IPS have similar types based on how they are deployed.

- **Network-based (NIDS/NIPS)**

  - Usually standalone devices installed on spam port or mirrored port from backbone switch.
  - Monitors network traffic patterns and supports centralized administration.
  - Detects network attacks on other systems, based on the placement of NIDS Sensor.
  - Generally more cost-effective to manage compared to HIDS.

- **Host-based (HIDS/HIPS)**

  - Usually installed on a server, configured to look for traffic to that endpoint.
  - Examines detailed events, including process calls and logs.
  - Detects specific file compromises and tracks attacker processes.
  - Can identify anomalies on the host system that network-based IDSs cannot.
  - More management-intensive, requiring attention on each system.

- **Wireless (WIDS/WIPS)**

  - Focused on wireless network, WIDS detect Denial of Service (DoS) attempts
  - Detects flooding authentication requests, de-authentication attacks, etc.

## IDS Detection Methods 

- **Signature-based IDS**

  - Detects intrusions by comparing traffic to a database of known attack patterns or signatures.
  - Can only detect attacks based on previously identified attacks in the database.
  - Highly effective at identifying known threats.
  - Low false-positive rate for known attacks.
  - Requires regular updates to maintain a current database of signatures.
  - Limited in detecting new, unknown threats or variations of known attacks.
  - Types:

    - **Pattern-matching**
      - Specific patterns of steps recognized during an attack.
      - More common in NIDS and WIDS.

    - **Stateful-matching**
      - Focus on known system baseline, reporting any changes to that state.
      - More common in HIDS.

- **Anomaly-based IDS**
  - Also known as "Behavioral-based IDS".
  - Identifies intrusions by detecting deviations from normal network behavior or baseline.
  - Higher false-positive rate due to variations in activities that deviate from the established norm.
  - Effective at discovering new and unknown threats.
  - Can adapt to changing network conditions and behaviors.
  - Types

    - **Statistical**
      - Uses statistical models to define normal behavior.
      - Detects unusual patterns; useful for known and unknown threats.
      - False positives if activity is variable; requires model updates.

    - **Protocol**
      - Monitors adherence to protocol standards.
      - Detects protocol-specific attacks; ensures protocol compliance.
      - Limited to protocol violations; may miss sophisticated attacks.

    - **Traffic**
      - Analyzes network traffic patterns and volumes.
      - Detects large-scale attacks like DDoS; monitors network health.
      - False positives in high-traffic environments; requires traffic analysis.

    - **Rule/Heuristic**
      - Uses predefined rules and heuristics.
      - Tailored detection; effective for complex patterns.
      - Requires rule updates; may miss novel attacks.

    - **Application-based**
      - Monitors specific applications.
      - Detects application-specific threats; deep insight into behavior.
      - Limited to monitored applications; requires knowledge of normal behavior.
