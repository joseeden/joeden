## SIEM 

A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a comprehensive security solution that collects, correlates, and analyzes log data from various sources across an organization's IT infrastructure.

A SIEM typically provides the following features:

- **Log consolidation**, which consists in collecting logs from various sources (like servers, firewalls or IDS/IPS) and then storing them in one central location.

- **Log retention**, which consists in storing logs for a specific period (like 90 days), so as to allow security analysts to keep track of and investigate past events.

- **Log encryption**, which is an optional feature that safeguards the confidentiality of log data.

- **Log analysis**, which involves identifying patterns, trends and anomalies related to security events, in or close to real time.

## Mobile Device Management 

Mobile Device Management (MDM) enables organizations to manage and secure mobile devices across various platforms (smartphones, tablets).

- Allows remote management and wiping of devices for data protection.
- Tracks device usage and location for monitoring and control.
- Enforce configuration to ensure devices are meeting the security benchmarks.
- Enforces security policies to enhance device security.
- Lowers risks tied to unsecured or outdated devices.

Example features:

- Disable a device's ability to sideload programs.
- Detect if a device has been jailbroken or rooted.
- Force each device to use a VPN connection.


## Software Defined Networking

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a networking approach that centralizes network control, enabling programmability and automation for improved network management and efficiency.

- **Data Plane**
  - Handles the **actual forwarding of data** packets within the network.
  - Performs packet switching or routing based on instructions received from the control plane.
  - Consists of switches, routers, and other network devices.

- **Control Plane**
  - Centralized controller that manages the behavior of the data plane.
  - Responsible for **making forwarding decisions** and configuring network devices.
  - Uses software-based algorithms and protocols to communicate with network devices.

- **Application Plane**
  - Interfaces with the control plane to define network policies and configurations.
  - Enables network administrators to deploy applications for specific network functions.
  - Examples include network monitoring, security, and traffic optimization applications.
