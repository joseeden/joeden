## Overview

DLP is a technology used to identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access, use, or transmission.

- Prevents unauthorized access, use, or transmission of sensitive data.
- Safeguards against accidental or malicious data sharing.
- Uses policies, monitoring, and enforcement to mitigate potential breaches.
- Protects against data leakage across channels like email, web, and endpoints.
- Involves content discovery, classification, encryption, and policy enforcement.

## Endpoint DLP System 

An Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system is a security solution designed to monitor and control data transfers on endpoint devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones, and tablets.

  - Detects sensitive data based on predefined rules.
  - Prevents unauthorized data transfers.
  - Enforces data security policies consistently.
  - Works like an IDS/IPS but for data 
  - Can be set to **detection mode** or **prevention mode**

## Network DLP System 

A Network Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system is a piece of software or hardware that monitors and control data transfers within a network infrastructure.

- Placed at the perimeter of the network.
- Detects **data-in-transit**; focused on things going out of the network.

## Storage DLP

A Storage Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system is a software installed on a server in a datacenter that inspects the data-at-rest.

- Safeguard sensitive **data stored** across different storage platforms.
- Ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.

## Cloud-based DLP

A DLP usually offered as a SaaS and is part of the cloud service and storage needs.

- Data stored in the cloud services are protected.
- Example: Google Drive
