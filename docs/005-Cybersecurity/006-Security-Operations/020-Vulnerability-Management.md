## Exposure Factor

Exposure Factor (EF) is a measure used in risk assessment to quantify the potential impact of a security breach on an organization.

- Represents the percentage of asset value lost due to a specific threat
- Used to estimate the financial impact of a security incident
- A key component in calculating the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

How to calculate: 

- EF is expressed as a percentage (0% to 100%)
- Determined by evaluating the extent of damage a threat can cause

   ```bash
   EF = Risk of downtime (hours) / 24 hours
   ```

Example:

- If an asset worth 100,000 USD has an EF of 40%, the expected loss from a specific threat would be $40,000.

## Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance refers to the level of risk an organization or individual is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives.

- The amount of uncertainty an organization is prepared to handle
- Balances potential benefits against possible adverse effects
- Influences decision-making and strategic planning
- Guides the development of risk management strategies
- Helps in setting appropriate risk thresholds and limits

Determinants:

- Organizational goals and objectives
- Industry standards and regulatory requirements
- Financial stability and resources
- Stakeholder expectations and risk perception

Example:

- A tech startup may have a higher risk tolerance, accepting the possibility of frequent changes and potential failures to innovate quickly.
- A financial institution, on the other hand, might have a low risk tolerance, prioritizing stability and regulatory compliance to protect client assets.



## Identifying Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability Scanning 

Automated method of probing networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities.

- Many tools available, including Nessus and OpenVAS.
- These tools can analyze your system's current state against known vulnerabilities.
- They can also generate a detailed report of vulnerabilities and criticality levels.
- Passive/non-invasive, compared to penetration tests.
- Should be ran periodically, either through manual or scheduled manner.

Types:

- **Credentialed Scan**, where host/device credentials is entered to scanning tool.
- **Uncredentialed Scan**, which mimics someone who doesn't have access

As a cybersecurity professional, you need to:

- Prioritize
- Patch
- Mitigate

### Penetration Testing

Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security posture.

- Attackers are likely to use similar attack vectors and techniques.
- Mitigate the identified issues found in the report.
- For more information, please see [Penetration Testing.](../006-Security-Operations/066-Penetration-Testing.md)

### Security and Process Auditing

Process that involves conducting a comprehensive review of the information systems, security policies, and procedures. This ensures the organization adheres to security best practices.

**Four-Step Process:**

1. **Planning**
   - Set clear goals for the audit, e.g. compliance, risk assessment, or performance evaluation.
   - Determine the systems, processes, and policies to be reviewed.
   - Allocate the necessary resources, including tools and personnel.
   - Establish a timeline for the audit process.

2. **Testing**
   - Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on test systems.
   - Evaluate current security policies, procedures, and controls.
   - Gather data through interviews, questionnaires, and reviewing documentation.
   - Analyze the collected data to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement.

3. **Implementing**
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings from the testing phase.
   - Create a plan to address identified vulnerabilities and improve security measures.
   - Implement the recommended changes and improvements.
   - Awareness programs, ensuring that staffs understand new policies and procedures.

4. **Auditing**
   - Verify that the implemented changes have been made and are effective.
   - Ensure that all changes comply with relevant regulations and standards.
   - Establish ongoing monitoring processes to maintain security and compliance.
   - Document audit findings, actions taken, and future recommendations.



## Analyzing Vulnerabilities

### True Positive
A true positive occurs when a security system correctly identifies a real threat.

- Accurate detection of a genuine vulnerability
- Ensures timely remediation
- Boosts confidence in the security system
- Reduces potential damage from attacks

### False Positive
A false positive happens when a security system incorrectly flags a non-threatening situation as a threat.

- Wastes time and resources investigating non-issues
- Can lead to alert fatigue
- May cause unnecessary panic
- Undermines trust in the security system

### True Negative
A true negative is when a security system correctly identifies that there is no threat present.

- Confirms the absence of vulnerabilities
- Reduces unnecessary alerts
- Supports the accuracy of the security system
- Helps maintain normal operations without interruptions

### False Negative
A false negative occurs when a security system **fails to detect a real threat**.

- Leaves vulnerabilities unaddressed
- Increases risk of undetected attacks
- Undermines the security posture
- Potentially leads to significant damage and breaches

## Prioritize, Classify. and Assess

### Prioritize 
Factors to consider when prioritizing vulnerabilities:

- Ease of exploitation 
- Magnitude of potential damage 
- Importance of affected system

### Classify 
Factors to consider when classifying vulnerabilities:

- Type of threat 
- Potential impact to the organization
- Systems or data that may be affected

Sample categories:

- Software flaws
- Configuration errors 
- Security policy gaps

Within each category, we can further sub-classify them, like:

- Buffer overflows 
- Privilege Escalation
- Insecure default settings 

### CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a standardized system for identifying and cataloging known security vulnerabilities in software and hardware.

- Helps in tracking and managing vulnerabilities
- Facilitates sharing and dissemination of information about vulnerabilities
- Referenced in security advisories and reports
- Integrated into vulnerability management and scanning tools
- Improves security assessment and patch management processes
- Assists in the prioritization of threat mitigation efforts

Structure:

- CVE IDs follow the format: CVE-YEAR-NUMBER (e.g., CVE-2024-12345)
- Each CVE entry includes a brief description of the vulnerability
- May contain references to further details, patches, or advisories

Link: cve.mitre.org

### Assessing Impact 

Vulnerabilities' impact can be assessed in terms of:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity 
- Availability

Impact can also be assessed based on the industy:

- Healthcare Vulnerabilities 
   - Risks patient data and safety.

- Financial Institution Vulnerabilities 
   - Lead to monetary losses and regulatory scrutiny.
