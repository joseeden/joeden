## Overview

Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a collection of open standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to automate vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation.

## Supported Languages

Three main languages used inside a SCAP: 

- **Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)**

    - Vulnerability Reporting Format
    - XML schema for reporting vulnerabilities and configuration issues.
    - Describe system information, machine state, and the reporting method.
    - Allows for consistent and interoperable way of collecting information.
     
- **Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)**

    - Security Automation Data 
    - XML schema for developing and auditing best practice configuration rules.
    - Describes security configuration guidelines and automated test procedures.
    - Before XCCDF, a long document containing step-by-step guide is used.
    - With XCCDF, we can use automated scanning tools to check the systems.
     
- **Asset Reporting Format (ARF)**

    - XML schema for expressing informattion about assets and relationships. 
    - Standardized format for reporting asset identification and metadata.
    - Vendor and technology neutral, suited for different reporting applications.

## Enumeration Methods

There are also different methods of enumerating assets.

- **Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)**

    - Security Checklists.
    - Configuration guidelines and best practices for secure system configuration.
    - Provides unique identifiers for different configuration system issues.

- **Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)**

    - Structured naming scheme for hardware, software, and operating systems.
    - Written in machine-readable format, with prefix:

        ```bash
        cpe:/ 
        ```
    - Standard format:

        ```bash
        cpe:/<part>:<vendor>:<product>:<version>:<update>:<edition>:<language>
        ```

    - Example:

        ```bash
        cpe:/a:microsoft:internet_explorer:11.0
        ```
     

- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**

    - List of records of vulnerability definitions.
    - Provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and exposures.
    - Each CVE has the following format:

        ```bash
        CVE-YYYY-NNNN         ## YYYY is year, NNNN is unique number.
        ```

## CVSS 

CVSS, or Common Vulnerability Scoring System, is a framework for assessing the severity and potential impact of security vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized method for rating vulnerabilities to help organizations prioritize their responses and allocate resources effectively.

- Scores are based on metrics evaluating exploitability and impact.
- Metrics include base, temporal, and environmental scores.
- Scores range from 0 to 10; higher scores indicating more severe vulnerabilities.
- Qualitative severity ratings such as Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

CVSS Ratings:

| CVSS Score Range | Severity Rating |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 0.0 - 3.9        | Low             |
| 4.0 - 6.9        | Medium          |
| 7.0 - 8.9        | High            |
| 9.0 - 10.0       | Critical        |

## Benchmarks 

A benchmark is a set of security configuration rules for some specific set or products to provide a detailed checklist that can be used to secure systems to a specific baseline.

- Usually expressed in the XCCDF.
- Examples are benchmark from Red Hat and CIS.
