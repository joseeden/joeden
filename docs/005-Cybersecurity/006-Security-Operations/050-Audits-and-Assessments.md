## Internal Audits

Internal Audits are systematic evaluations of the effectiveness of internal controls, compliance, and integrity of information systems and processes.

- Focuses on data protection, network security, access controls, and incident response.
- Example: Internal review of password policies, user access controls

### How it works

1. Internal audit team checks control policies and procedures agains best practices and regulatory requirements.
2. User access rights is examined ensure each employee's access is align with their responsibilities.
3. Audit team verifies user access rights processes, including approvals and timely revocation.
4. Finally, they test the effectiveness of access controls using accounts with limited permissions.
5. Findings are documented and used as basis for recommendation for procedure improvements

### Compliance

Compliance ensures that information systems and security practices meet established standards, regulations, and laws.

- Crucial for protecting sensitive data and avoiding legal penalties.
- Involves implementing specific security controls and maintaining policies and procedures.
- Regularly auditing and assessing the organization's security posture.

For more information, please see [Compliance as a Governance Element.](../001-Fundamentals/046-Compliance.md)

### Audit Committee

A group of people responsible for supervising the organization's audit and compliance functions.

- Typically members of the company's board of directors.
- Reviews the organization's financial reporting processes and internal controls.
- Ensures the organization is in compliance with legal regulatory requirements.
- Addresses any issues raised by auditors.

## Internal Assessments

An in-depth analysis to identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems.

- Often performed before implementing new systems or before making any changes to existing ones.
- Identify gaps in an organization's compliance efforts and to prepare for formal audits.
- Most are conducted as **Self-assessments** - conducted to gauge adherence to standards and regulations.

### Assessment Process 

1. Conducting threat modelling exercise to identify potential threats.
2. Combination of automated tools and manual testing techniques are used to assess vulnerabilities.
3. Risks assessment, for evaluating potential impact of the identified threats and the cost of implementing security measures.
4. Mitigation strategies are recommended based on the assessment results

## Penetration Testing 

Penetration Testing is a simulated cyber attack that helps in the assessment of computer systems for exploitable vulnerabilities.

- Agree on methodology and rules of engagement before performing pentests.
- Simulate network intrusion based on threat scenarios.
- Normally triggers IDS/IPS alerts. If it doesn't, then this should also be reported.
- There's a **specific goal in mind.**

Types:

- Physical Pentesting
- Offensive Pentesting
- Defensive Pentesting
- Integrated Pentesting

### Physical Pentesting

Physical pentesting involves evaluating the physical security measures of a facility to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive areas or information.

- Assesses physical barriers such as locks, doors, and gates.
- Tests the effectiveness of security personnel and protocols.
- Evaluates the security of entry points, such as windows and ventilation systems.
- Identifies potential social engineering vulnerabilities, like tailgating.
- Raises awareness about the importance of physical security among employees.

### Offensive Pentesting

Offensive pentesting, also known as **red teaming**, is a **proactive** approach that focuses on simulating real-world attacks to identify weaknesses in an organization's security infrastructure from an attacker's perspective.

- Identifies vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications.
- Evaluates response capabilities of security teams.
- Provides actionable insights for improving security posture.
- Results can also used to garner more funding and support for cybersecurity investments.

### Defensive Pentesting

Defensive pentesting, also known as **blue teaming**, is a **reactive** approach that emphasizes identifying and fortifying weaknesses within an organization's defenses by simulating potential attack scenarios.

- Focuses on strengthening existing security measures.
- Enhances incident detection and response capabilities.
- Conducts regular security assessments to identify new vulnerabilities.
- Collaborates with offensive teams to improve overall security.

### Integrated Pentesting

Integrated pentesting, also known as **purple teaming**, combines both offensive and defensive strategies to create a comprehensive security evaluation, ensuring that both attack simulations and defensive measures are optimized.

- Merges red and blue team methodologies for holistic security testing.
- Identifies and addresses both internal and external threats.
- Enhances coordination between offensive and defensive security teams.
- Provides a thorough analysis of an organization's security posture.

## Penetration Testing Process 

Penetration testing is a structured approach to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a system to assess its security.

1. **Rules of Engagement**

    - Define the scope and objectives of the test.
    - Establish clear communication channels and protocols.
    - Ensure legal and ethical boundaries are respected.

2. **Discovery/Enumeration**

    - Gather information about the target system.
    - Identify open ports, services, and potential entry points.
    - Map the network and identify connected devices.

3. **Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation**

    - Scan for known vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
    - Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
    - Validate the exploitability and impact of each vulnerability.

4. **Privilege Escalation, Backdoors, and Pivoting**

    - Attempt to gain higher-level access to the system.
    - Install backdoors for future access if permitted.
    - Use the compromised system to access other network areas.

5. **Cleanup**

    - Remove any tools or scripts used during the test.
    - Restore the system to its original state.
    - Ensure no traces of the test remain on the target.

6. **Report Findings**

    - Document all discovered vulnerabilities and exploited weaknesses.
    - Provide detailed findings, including evidence and impact analysis.
    - Offer recommendations for remediation and improving security posture.


## Reconnaisance in Pentesting

Reconnaissance, also known as **information gathering**, is the first phase of a penetration test where the pentester collects as much information as possible about the target system to identify potential vulnerabilities.

- Helps in identifying potential entry points for an attack.
- Provides critical information to tailor the penetration test to the specific target.
- Proper reconnaissance can help in planning stealthy attacks to avoid detection.
- Ensures overall test effectiveness by covering all possible vulnerabilities.

### Types of Reconnaissance

**Active Reconnaissance**

- Directly interacting with the target system to gather detailed information.
- Performing network scans to identify active devices and services.
- Sending probes or queries to the target to elicit responses.
- Utilizing tools like ping sweeps and traceroutes to map network paths.
- While it can yield a lot of information, it also carries a higher risk of detection.

**Passive Reconnaissance**

- Gathering information without directly interacting with the target system to avoid detection.
- Analyzing publicly available data such as website content and social media profiles.
- Reviewing public records and documentation for insights.
- Monitoring news articles and press releases for information leaks.
- Less likely to be detected, but can yield less information.


### Environment Classifications 

Environment classifications define the level of information available to the tester about the target system. This classification helps in simulating different attack scenarios, ranging from those performed by internal employees to external attackers with no prior knowledge of the system.

**Known Environment**

- Tester has full knowledge of the target system's architecture, configurations, and security measures.
- Focuses on known assets, evaluating vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- Often referred to as **white-box testing**.
- Allows for comprehensive and detailed testing.
- Resembles an insider threat scenario.
- Typically used for internal audits and in-depth security assessments.

**Partially Known Environment**

- The tester has limited knowledge about the target system.
- Also known as **grey-box testing**.
- Combines elements of both known and unknown environments.
- Balances thoroughness and realistic attack scenarios.
- Often used when some information is available but full details are not disclosed.
- Uncovers vulnerabilities in known assets, as well as vulnerabilities in hidden or forgotten assets.


**Unknown Environment**

- The tester has no prior knowledge of the target system.
- Commonly referred to as **black-box testing**.
- Simulates a real-world external attacker, where attacker knows little to nothing about the target.
- Relies heavily on reconnaissance and discovery techniques.
- Provides an unbiased view of the system's security posture from an outsider’s perspective.

### Methods and Techniques

## Attestation of Findings 

Process that involves the formal validation or confirmation provided by an entity that is used to assert the accuracy and authenticity of a specific information.

- Signifies that the findings of the penetration testing is valid based on the evidence.
- Organizations may require a letter of attestation from the pentesting firm to show as an official record.
- Should include the summary of findings and the evidence that the security assessment is conducted.
- Evidences might include data, logs, explanations, or even some of the exploit code.
- Some evidences can be showed during the attestation meeting, but doesn't need to leave the evidence.
- In contrast to pentesting reports, which are actually delivered and left to the organization.

Types: 

- Software Attestation
- Hardware Attestation
- System Attestation
