## Patch Management 

Patch Management involves updating software to address vulnerabilities and improve security.
- Ensures systems are protected against known threats.
- Key for maintaining a secure and resilient IT infrastructure.

**Challenges and Best Practices**

- Patches may disrupt system stability.
- Balancing rapid deployment with stability is crucial.
- Test patches in a qualification environment before production.
- Relying solely on vendor reputation for patch qualification is insufficient.
- Applying patches on fixed days doesn't ensure post-patch stability.

## Terms 

**Software Patch**
  
- A software patch is a quick-repair solution for programming issues. 
- Designed to address functionality problems, enhance security.
- Introduces new functionalities to improve user experience.

**Hotfix**

- Also known as "Quick-Fix", it solves a security issue.
- Cumulative package addressing specific issues in a software product.
- Should be applied immediately after being tested in a lab environment. 

**Updates**

- An update provides the system with additional functionality,
- It does not usually provide any patching of security related issues. 
- Often introduce new security vulnerabilities, which may require another hotfix.

**Service Pack**
  
- Collection of updates, fixes, or enhancements bundled into a single installable package.
- Provides comprehensive improvements to a software program.

## Recommendations

1. Designate a team to monitor vendor security patches.
2. Implement automated system-wide patching for OS and apps.
3. Extend patch management to cover cloud resources.
4. Prioritize patches as urgent, important, or non-critical.
5. Validate critical patches in test environments before deployment.
6. Keep detailed patching logs for evaluation and monitoring.
7. Define a process for assessing, testing, and applying firmware updates.
8. Establish a technical procedure for deploying urgent patches.
9. Regularly review non-critical patches for combined deployment.
