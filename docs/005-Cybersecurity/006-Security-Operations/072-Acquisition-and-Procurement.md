## Difference between the two 

- **Acquisition** is the process of obtaining goods and services
- **Procurement** refers to the entire process of acquiring goods and services, including all the processes that lead up to the actual acquisition. 

## Purchase Options 

- **Company Credit Card**

- **Individual Purchase**

  - Allows employees to purchase items independently.
  - May require **reimbursement** procedures.
  - Provides control over small, infrequent purchases.
  - Usually done when an employee is asked to travel on behalf of the company.
  - Useful for spontaneous or urgent needs.

- **Use of Purchase Orders**

  - Formalizes the request for goods or services from suppliers.
  - Helps in managing and tracking larger, planned purchases.
  - Provides a legal document to ensure terms and conditions are met.

  - Company's financial department sends the PO as form of "promise to pay" to the vendor.
