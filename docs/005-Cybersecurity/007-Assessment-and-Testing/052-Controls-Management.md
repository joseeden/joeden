## Routine Management of Security Controls  

In addition to regular security audits, organizations should consistently manage their security controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness.

- Perform regular control testing and monitoring.
- Manage exceptions, create remediation plans, and use compensating controls when necessary.

## Control Testing Procedures  

Control testing is crucial for maintaining security but should not rely solely on periodic audits. Regular monitoring ensures any issues are caught promptly.

- Implement routine automated monitoring, such as firewall checks.
- Supplement audits with frequent checks.

## Handling Exceptions to Controls  

Security rules often have exceptions, and organizations need a clear process for handling them, ensuring proper documentation and authorization.

- Define a formal process for requesting and approving exceptions.
- Document exceptions with reasons and risk justifications.

## Compensating Controls  

Compensating controls are alternative security measures that mitigate risks when exceptions are made to standard controls.

- Ensure compensating controls meet the intent of the original control.
- The compensating control must provide a similar level of protection.
