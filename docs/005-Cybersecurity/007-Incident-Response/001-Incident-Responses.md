## Terminologies

Understanding incident response begins with knowing the terms for various cyberattacks.


| Terminology         | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Breach**          | The loss of control or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information. (NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5)                                                                    |
| **Event**           | Any observable occurrence in a network or system. (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)                                                                                                     |
| **Exploit**         | A specific attack that targets a system vulnerability.                                                                                                                        |
| **Incident**        | An unplanned event impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information, requiring a response.                                                            |
| **Intrusion**       | An event where an intruder gains or attempts to gain unauthorized system access. (IETF RFC 4949 Ver. 2)                                                                       |
| **Threat**          | A circumstance or event with the potential to harm organizational operations, assets, or individuals through unauthorized access or data destruction. (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1) |
| **Vulnerability**   | A weakness in a system or security process that could be exploited by a threat source. (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1)                                                                |
| **Attacks**         | Deliberate actions or activities carried out by threat actors with the intent to exploit vulnerabilities. |
| **Zero Day**        | An unknown system vulnerability that could be exploited without typical detection or prevention.                                                                              |
| **Impact**          | The expected harm from unauthorized data disclosure, modification, or loss.                                                                                                   |

## Indicators of Compromise 

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are evidence or clues that suggest a computer system or network has been breached or compromised by malicious actors. These indicators can take various forms and are used by cybersecurity professionals to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. 

- Malware Signatures
- Anomalous Network Traffic
- Unauthorized Access Attempts
- Unusual File or System Modifications
- Abnormal User Behavior
- Phishing or Social Engineering Indicators
- Security Alerts or Warnings
- Unusual System Performance
- Suspicious File Attachments or Downloads
- IoT Device Anomalies

## Goal of Incident Response

The objectives of Incident Response:

- Organizations must prepare for incidents despite preventive measures.
- Incident response prioritizes safety and aims to minimize impact.
- **Crisis management** is sometimes used interchangeably with incident management.
- Events disrupting the business mission are termed **incidents**.
- An incident response plan ensures business viability.
- The incident response process aims to minimize impact and resume operations swiftly.
- It's a subset of the broader business continuity management (BCM).
