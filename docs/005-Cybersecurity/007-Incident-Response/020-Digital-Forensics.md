## Digital Forensics

Digital forensics is the process of investigating and analyzing digital devices and data to uncover evidence 

- Collect and preserve evidence for legal purposes.
- Always adhere to the organization's written procedures.
- This ensures that the investigation is performed correctly.

## Phases of Digital Forensics

- Identification 
- Collection
- Analysis 
- Reporting

### Identification 

Recognizing and determining relevant data or digital evidence.

- Identify the devices and data sources.
- Determine what is considered potential evidence.
- Define the scope and boundaries of the investigation.

### Collection

Gathering and acquiring digital evidence while preserving its integrity.

- Proper handling and documentation to maintain a chain of custody.
- Use forensically sound methods to collect data.
- Maintain a clear **chain of custody**.
- Document each step in the collection process.
- Follow proper acquisition procedure.

### Analysis 

Examining collected data to uncover relevant information, patterns, or evidence.

- Examine the data for hidden, deleted, or altered information.
- Use specialized tools to analyze different types of digital evidence.
- Draw connections and correlations among different data points.

### Reporting

The final phase where findings from the analysis are documented and presented.

- Prepare a detailed and coherent report of findings.
- Ensure the report is accessible to non-technical audiences.
- Include necessary information for legal proceedings, such as evidence handling and conclusions.

## Data Acquisition 

The method and tools used to create a forensically sound copy of the data from a source device, such as system memory or a hard disk.

- BYOD Policies - legally complicated, as it may not be possible to search and seize the device.
- How to collect data, e.g. shutdown, collect while device is powered on.
- There could be evidence loss if device is shut down.

## Chain of Custody

The Chain of Custody is the documented process that tracks the handling, transfer, and storage of evidence from its collection to its final presentation in court or other legal settings. 

- **Documentation** - Records each step of evidence collection, transfer, and storage.
- **Evidence Handling** - Ensures evidence is handled consistently to prevent tampering or contamination.
- **Transfer of Evidence** - Logs when evidence changes hands, including who, when, and why.
- **Storage Security** - Maintains secure storage of evidence to prevent unauthorized access or loss.
- **Legal Validity** - A clear chain of custody helps ensure evidence is admissible in court by demonstrating its integrity.

## Code of Ethics 

Forensic analysts must adhere to a code of ethics.

### Avoid Bias

  - Maintain objectivity and impartiality in all analyses.
  - Base conclusions on evidence, not personal beliefs or external pressures.

### Repeatable Actions

  - Ensure forensic processes are consistent and reproducible.
  - Document methods to allow others to verify or replicate findings.
  - When doing forensic analysis, take note of:
    - Time 
    - Action
    - Results

### Preservation of Evidence

  - Handle evidence in a way that maintains its integrity.
  - Follow procedures to avoid contamination, tampering, or loss of evidence.
