## Overview

Vulnerability scans identify security weaknesses in systems and networks, helping organizations prioritize and mitigate potential risks.

- Uncover weak points that attackers might exploit.
- Compare systems against known vulnerabilities.
- Help maintain security by routine checks.


## Scanners 

There are three primary categories of scanners used to assess security:

- **Port Scanners**

   - Identify open ports on a network or system.
   - Help detect services that might be vulnerable to attack.

- **Vulnerability Scanners**

   - Identify security flaws in systems and networks.
   - Compare systems against known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

- **Application Scanners**

   - Scan web applications for security weaknesses.
   - Detect vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations.


## Types of scans

### Vulnerability Scan

Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in systems or networks by checking against known security flaws.

- **Non-Intrusive Scanning**
   - Gathers information without actively exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - Minimizes the risk of disruption to systems.
   - Safer for production environments.

- **Intrusive Scanning**
   - Actively tests for vulnerabilities by simulating an attack.
   - Can identify more issues but might disrupt services.
   - Best for testing in non-production environments.

### Configuration Scan

Ensures systems are securely configured to meet security standards and prevent misconfigurations that could create vulnerabilities.

- Checks the settings and configurations of systems and applications.
- Identify misconfigurations that could lead to security issues.
- Ensure compliance with security policies and best practices.

### Code Scan

Analyzes source code to detect security flaws before deployment.

- Detect coding errors and potential security weaknesses before deployment.
- Use SAST tools such as Fortify or Sonarqube to examine the source code.
- Integrated into the SDLC to ensure secure coding practices.


## Credentialed Scans

Uses credentials to provide deeper insights into the system, checking configurations and permissions more thoroughly.

- Gathers detailed configuration data with read-only access.
- Detects hidden vulnerabilities that uncredentialed scans might miss.


## Scan Reports 

Scan reports categorize findings to differentiate between real and false alerts, ensuring effective remediation.

- **False Negative**: A real vulnerability is missed.
- **False Positive**: A non-threatening issue is flagged.
- **True Positive**: A real vulnerability is accurately identified.
- **True Negative**: Non-malicious activities are recognized as safe.
