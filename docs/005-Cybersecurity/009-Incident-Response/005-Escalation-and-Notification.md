## First Responder Mode

When a potential incident is detected, security professionals must act immediately to contain the situation.

- Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
- Contain the damage caused by the incident.
- Move into the escalation and notification process after immediate actions are taken.

## Escalation and Notification Process

This process ensures incidents are properly evaluated, escalated, and reported to stakeholders.

- Evaluate the severity of the incident based on potential impact on security.
- Escalate the incident to the appropriate level of response.
- Notify management and stakeholders about the incident and planned resolutions.

## Incident Severity Ratings

Organizations typically classify incidents based on their potential impact.

- **Low-Impact Incidents** 

    - Have minimal effect on confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
    - First responders usually handle the issue themselves.
    - No immediate need for escalation or notification unless it worsens.
    - Typically no after-hours response required.

- **Moderate-Impact Incidents** 

    - May significantly affect security.
    - Usually triggers activation of the incident response team.
    - Management is notified.

- **High-Impact Incidents** 

    - Cause critical damage and require an immediate full response.
    - Senior executives are notified immediately.
    - Full incident response team is mobilized.
    - Other team members are placed on standby.

## Escalation and Notification Tools

The process of notifying and escalating incidents should be well thought out and supported by tools.

- Clear procedures must be in place for first responders to follow.
- Mobile contact lists for key personnel should be available.
- Some organizations may use technology solutions that automate team responses.
