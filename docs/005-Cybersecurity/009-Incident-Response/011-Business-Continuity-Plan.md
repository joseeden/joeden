## Overview

A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a pre-determined set of instructions describing how the mission/business processes of an organization will be sustained **during** and **after** a significant disruption.

Key elements involve:

- Phone trees for multiple contact methods.
- Systematic use of procedures and checklists for assigning responsibilities.
- Prompt activation with involvement from management and authorized individuals.
- Maintenance of critical contact numbers for various entities.
- Access to designated numbers and military-grade networks during severe cyberattacks or major disruptions.


## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating potential threats and vulnerabilities that could disrupt business operations.

- Identify potential risks, including external and internal threats.
- Assess the potential impact of these risks on critical functions.

A combination of approaches is recommended:

- **Quantitative risk assessment**: Calculate financial losses, e.g., if a server fails.
- **Qualitative risk assessment**: Assess non-financial impacts, like reputation damage.



## Business Impact Analysis

Prioritize mission-critical processes:

- Determine critical business functions, processes, and their dependencies.
- Quantify the impact of disruptions on these functions.
- Helps prioritize recovery efforts and allocate resources effectively.

Key considerations include:

- Identify sensitive data 
- Identify single points of failure

Potential business impacts

- Fines 
- Loss of contracts
- Reputation Loss
- Data Loss
    - Breach notification 
    - Escalation requirements 
    - Data exfiltration

- Streamlines decision-making processes in a crisis.
- Establishes a command structure and roles during emergencies.
- Sets communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders.


## Backup and Recovery 

Backup and Recovery strategies ensure data and systems can be restored after a disruption.

- Develop recovery strategies for IT systems and infrastructure.

## Alternate Site and Facilities

Identifying alternate sites is crucial for maintaining business operations during disruptions.

- Designate alternate locations for business continuity.
- Ensure necessary facilities are available during emergencies.


## Resource Management

- Plan for remote work options and workforce continuity.
- Ensure access to critical resources for business recovery.

## Training/Awareness Programs

Training and awareness programs help prepare employees for business continuity protocols.

- Conduct regular drills and training sessions for employees.
- Raise awareness about BCP protocols and procedures.

## Supplier/Vendor Relationships

Managing supplier and vendor relationships is key for maintaining supply chain continuity.

- Assess the continuity plans of key suppliers and vendors.
- Develop contingency plans for supply chain disruptions.

##  Testing and Exercising

Regular testing and exercising of the BCP validate the effectiveness of response strategies.

- Conduct regular tests to evaluate the BCP's effectiveness.
- Simulate Business Continuity exercises to practice response strategies.

##  Documentation and Reporting

Documentation and reporting ensure transparency and accountability in incident management.

- Maintain up-to-date documentation of the BCP.
- Establish reporting mechanisms for incidents and recovery progress.

##  Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement involves regularly updating the BCP based on insights gained from incidents and exercises.

- Review and update the BCP periodically.
- Incorporate lessons learned from real incidents or exercises.
