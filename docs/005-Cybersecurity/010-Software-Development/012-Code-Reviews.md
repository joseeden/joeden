## Overview

Code reviews involve examining the source code to identify and address security vulnerabilities and coding errors.

- Ensures that code adheres to security best practices and standards.
- Detects potential vulnerabilities before the code is deployed.
- Improves code quality and reduces the risk of security flaws.

Mature organizations integrate peer-based code reviews into their software promotion and release processes. They also use design reviews to vet development plans prior to creating code.

## Fagan Inspections

Fagan Inspections are a formal review process used to identify defects in software early in the development cycle. This process involves a structured examination of work products such as requirements, design documents, and code by a team of reviewers to ensure quality and correctness. It also ocuses on early detection of issues to reduce costs and improve final product quality.

Fagan Inspections follow a structured six-step process:

1. **Planning**

   - Set goals and define the inspection scope
   - Assemble a team with relevant expertise
   - Schedule meetings and allocate resources
   - Prepare and distribute review materials

2. **Overview**

   - Present work products and inspection objectives
   - Explain goals and focus areas

3. **Preparation**

   - Review materials individually
   - Identify defects and improvement areas

4. **Meeting**

   - Discuss findings and document defects
   - Assign tasks for fixing issues

5. **Rework**

   - Author revises based on feedback
   - Correct defects and make improvements

6. **Follow-Up**

   - Verify that defects are fixed
   - Document inspection results and lessons learned
