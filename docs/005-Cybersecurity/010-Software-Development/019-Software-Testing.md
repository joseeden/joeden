## Overview 

Throughout the software development process, frequent testing ensures that the final product meets both functional and business requirements.

- Essential for proper functionality
- Key activities: validation and verification

## Model Validation vs. Verification  

These two important testing activities answer different questions during development.

- **Validation**: Are we building the right software? (Meets business requirements)
- **Verification**: Are we building the software right? (Proper functioning)

## Stress and Load Testing  

Before release, code must be tested under real-world conditions to ensure it can handle expected loads.

- Simulates real-world activity using automated scripts
- Verifies system capacity and maximum load capabilities
- Tests continue until system failure to determine limits

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)  

This final phase ensures that the software is intuitive and usable under real-world circumstances.

- Performed in a testing environment
- End users simulate real-world transactions
- Focus on usability and ease of use (often referred to as "beta testing")

## Regression Testing  

After launch, modifications to the software must be tested to ensure they donâ€™t cause unintended issues.

- Verifies no negative impacts from code changes
- Compares system behavior before and after updates
- Focuses on maintaining functionality while adding new features
