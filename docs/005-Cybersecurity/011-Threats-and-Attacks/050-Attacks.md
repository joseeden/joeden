## Attacks 

An attempt to compromise the security, availability, or integrity of an IP (Internet Protocol) network.

## Password Attacks 

Attempts to gain unauthorized access by cracking or stealing passwords.

### Brute Force Attack 

A brute force attack uses every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to guess a user's password.

**Mitigations** 

  - Enforce strong and complex password creation policies.
  - Temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts.
  - Restrict the number of login attempts within a specific time frame.
  - Keep systems and software up-to-date to address vulnerabilities.

### Dictionary Attack 

A dictionary attack is a type of attack that uses a list of common words to guess a user's password. 

**Mitigations** 

  - Enforce strong and complex password creation policies.
  - Temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts.
  - Use a secure hashing algorithm with a unique salt for each password.
  - Keep systems and software up-to-date to address vulnerabilities.
  - Add an additional authentication layer - MFA

### Password Spraying 

A form of brute force attack that involves trying a small number of commonly used passwords against a large number of username and accounts. 

- Effective, can avoid triggering account lockouts from too many failed login attempts. 
- In a large group of user, there's a good chance some of them uses very common and weak passwords.
- Slower (per-account basis), since each common password is tried on each user first.

**Mitigation:**

- Rate limiting on login attempts to slow down brute force attacks.
- Regular password changes to minimize risks from compromised accounts.
- Ensure users create complex passwords to avoid common and weak ones.
- Monitor for unusual login attempts or patterns.

### Hybrid Attack 

Blends brute force and dictionary techniques by using common passwords with variations, such as adding numbers and special characters.

**Mitigation:**

- Encourage complex passwords - less susceptible to variations.
- Recommend long, randomly generated passwords.
- Lock accounts after repeated failed attempts.
- Implement rate limiting to slow down hybrid attacks.
- Educate users about secure password practices.

### Birthday Attack 

Cybercriminals use birthday attacks to trick systems by cracking digital authentication methods.

**The Birthday Paradox**

  - High odds of at least two will share a birthday in a random group of people. 
  - Easier to find two colliding results of different inputs than generating all possible outputs.

**Birthday Attack in Cybersecurity**

  - Attackers aim to find hash collisions to break security. 
  - Used to crack weak hash functions or forge digital signatures.

**Finding the Collision**

  1. A program repeatedly runs the hash function on randomly selected inputs.
  2. Every input-output pair is stored in a database.
  3. Each output is checked to find collisions (different inputs produce the same output).
  4. Attackers then exploit hash collisions to trick the system into treating different messages as identical.

**Mitigations**
  
  - Use hash functions with large bit sizes; avoid outdated algorithms.

## Cryptographic Attacks 

In simplests terms, we can perform cryptographic attacks by:

1. Attacking the algorithm
2. Attacking the implementation
3. Attacking the key

### Downgrade Attacks

Also known as **version rollback attack**, downgrade attacks force a system to use a less secure version of a protocol, making it vulnerable to known exploits. 

**How it works**

- Attacker manipulates communication exchanges.
- This makes the parties believe they should use a less secure version of a protocol or a weaker encryption algorithm.
- Achieved by any of the following:
  - Intercepting and altering communication
  - Exploiting fallback mechanisms
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in protocol negotiation.

**Examples**
  - In HTTPS, an attacker could force a secure connection to revert to an older SSL version with known vulnerabilities.
  - In wireless networks, an attacker might trick a device into connecting to a less secure network.
  - **POODLE Attack** - Padding Oracle on Downgraded Legacty Encryption, which targeted SSL 3.0.

**Mitigations**

- **Protocol Hardening**: 
  - Ensure protocols do not support older, insecure versions. 
  - For example, disable SSL and only use modern TLS versions.

- **Strict Negotiation**: 
  - Implement strict rules for protocol negotiation.
  - This prevents fallback to less secure versions.

- **Secure Communication**: 
  - Use certificates and mutual authentication to validate communication channels and avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Regular Updates**: 
  - Keep software and systems updated to the latest secure versions, removing outdated protocol support.



### Collision Attacks

Collision attacks find two different inputs that produce the same hash, potentially compromising cryptographic integrity. 

- To breach the integrity of a cryptographic system.
- Exploit vulnerabilities in hash-based security.

**How It Works**

- The attacker tries to find two different inputs that yield the same hash.
- This can be used to forge digital signatures, tamper with data, or bypass security checks.

**Examples**

- MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions have known vulnerabilities allowing collision attacks.
- Birthday Attacks
- Certificate forgery, where an attacker can create a fraudulent certificate with the same hash as a legitimate one.

**Mitigations**

- **Use Secure Hash Functions**:
  - Choose hash functions with no known vulnerabilities. 
  - Avoid MD5 and SHA-1; opt for SHA-256 or stronger.

- **Implement Collision-Resistant Algorithms**: 
  - Employ algorithms designed to resist collisions, especially in digital signatures and certificate generation.

- **Detect Anomalies**: 
  - Implement mechanisms to detect unusual patterns that might indicate a collision attack.

- **Regularly Update Security Practices**: 
  - Stay updated with the latest cryptographic standards and replace vulnerable hash functions as necessary.




### Quantum Computing

Quantum computing poses a threat to traditional cryptography by potentially breaking key cryptographic algorithms. 
  
**How It Works**

- Quantum computers use qubits, which can represent multiple states simultaneously.
- This enables parallel processing at a massive scale.
- This allows quantum computers to run algorithms that can break traditional cryptographic methods.
- Example: Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.
  
**Implications for Cryptography**

- Quantum computing threatens public-key encryption algorithms like RSA and ECC.
- RSA and ECC rely on computational hardness (e.g., factoring large numbers).
- Symmetric key algorithms are more resistant but require longer key lengths to remain secure.
- **Post-quantum cryptography**, which aims to create algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.
  
  - CRYSTALS-Dilithium 
  - FALCON 
  - SPHINCS+


**Mitigations**

- **Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography**: 

  - Adopt cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand quantum attacks.
  - Examples are lattice-based or hash-based algorithms.

- **Use Larger Key Sizes**: 

  - Increase key sizes in symmetric encryption.
  - This provides a greater buffer against quantum computing threats.

- **Hybrid Cryptographic Systems**: 

  - Implement systems that use a mix of traditional and post-quantum cryptographic techniques.

- **Monitor Quantum Advancements**: 

  - Keep informed about developments in quantum computing and adapt security strategies accordingly.

### Rainbow Table Attack 

A rainbow table attack uses precomputed hashes to find a matching hash value for a user's password (see ISC2 Study Guide, Module 2, under Types of Threats). 

**Mitigations** 

  - Add a unique random value (salt) to each password before hashing.
  - Choose robust cryptographic hash functions resistant to rainbow tables.
  - Enforce strong and complex password creation policies.
  - Stay current with advancements, adopting newer, more secure hash functions.
  - Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)


### Pass the Hash Attack

A "pass the hash" attack involves using a hashed password to gain unauthorized access to a system, bypassing the need for the plaintext password. Attackers obtain the hash and use it to authenticate without knowing the actual password.

- Attackers steal password hashes from compromised systems.
- They use these hashes to authenticate, avoiding password-based checks.
- Common in Windows environments with NTLM authentication.


**Mimikatz**

  - An open-source tool for security testing and penetration testing.
  - Extracts plaintext passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets from memory.
  - Enables "pass the hash" and "pass the ticket" attacks.
  - Manipulates Windows authentication tokens.

**Common Use Cases of Mimikatz**

  - Used by penetration testers to assess security on Windows systems.
  - Often exploited by hackers for unauthorized access.

**Mitigation Measures**

  - Apply multi-factor authentication.
  - Keep Windows systems updated with security patches.
  - Limit administrative access and use secure password management.
  - Ensure only trusted OS are allowed to connect to your servers.
  - Implement least privilege for all user accounts.


## Social Engineering Attacks

- Exploits vulnerabilities in these websites to launch phishing attacks against the targeted group.
- Often used to compromise organizations by infecting their employees' devices or stealing sensitive information.
- Mimics the behavior of predators waiting near water sources to ambush prey, hence "watering hole" attack.
  
Mitigation:

- Regularly updating website software
- Implementing web application firewalls
- Educating users about the risks of visiting untrusted websites.

### Adversarial Artificial Intelligence

AI systems designed to deceive, manipulate, or exploit vulnerabilities in other AI systems or human users.

### Typosquatting   

Attacker registers a domain name similar to a popular website. The "copycat" domain name usually contains some kind of common typographical errors.

- Goal is to victimize users who might accidentally mistype a URL.
- Can trick users pretty easily, if they're not looking carefully at the URL.
- Example: Registering "gnail.com" to impersonate gmail.com




## Denial of Service Attacks

An attack that attempts to overload a network or website with traffic to make it unavailable.

Mitigation:

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit requests per user or IP address.
- **CDNs**: Disperse network traffic.
- **DDoS Protection**: Use specialized services for DDoS mitigation.
- **Firewalls and IPS**: Detect and block DoS patterns.

### Flood Attack 

A specialized type of of DoS which attempts to send more packets to a single serve or host than it can handle.

Variations:

- **Ping Flood**

  - A server is sent with too many pings (ICMP request packet).
  - Many organizations are now blocking echo replies.
  - Firewall could be configured to drop these requests.

- **SYN Flood**

  - Attacker initiates multiple TCP sessions but never complete the 3-way handshake.
  - SYN packets could be sent with made-up IP addresses.
  - Server replies to establish the 3-way handshake but no one responds.
  - Server reserves resouces to wait for these acknowledgements from these clients.
  - With enough requests, server will run out of resources.
  - Mitigation:
    - Flood guards - detect SYN floods and block request at the network boundary.
    - Timeouts - stop connections after a period of time, e.g. 10, 15, 30 seconds
    - IPS - can detect and respond to SYN floods.

### Permanent DoS

An attack which exploits a security flaw by reflashing a firmware, permanently breaking the device.

- Device is unable to reboot itself because the OS is overwritten.
- Its permanent, because a quick reboot won't bring it back online.
- Device has to be taken offline and have a full firmware reload.

### Fork Bomb 

A large number of processes is created to use up a computer's available processing power.

- The process is called **fork**
- Process can be forked into more processes until it eats up all resources.
- **Not a worm**, they don't infect programs and don't spread in the network.
- Instead they spread to the processor's cache on a single computer.


### Distributed DoS

With DDoS, more machines are used to launch an attack simultaneously against a single server to create a denial of service condition.

- Usually the machines don't also know they're part of the attack.
- Machines can become zombies or bots inside a large botnet

### DNS Amplification 

A specialized DDoS attack that allows an attacker to initiate DNS requests from a spoof IP address to flood a website.

- High volume of packets are sent, DNS servers respond to the request.
- Response from the DNS server takes up a lot of bandwidth.

For more information, please see [DNS Amplification Attack.](#dns-amplification-attack) 

### Stopping DDoS 

- **Blackhole/Sinkhole**

  - Identifies the attacking IP addresses and routes traffic to non-existent server.
  - Effectively stops attack, but attackers can still move to new IP.

- **IDS/IPS**

  - Identify and respond to DoS attacks.
  - Works for small-scale attacks but not large-scale, not enough processing power.

- **Elastic Cloud Infrastructure**

  - Builds the infrastructure in a scalable way,
  - Cloud providers charge you based on resources used.
  - No return on investment, these traffic are wasted, they don't generate revenue.
  - There are specialized cloud providers for DDoS protection:
    - CloudFlare 
    - Akamai

## Spoofing Attacks

### Session Hijacking 

**Session Management**

- A fundamental security component that enables web applications to identify a user.
- Uniquely identify user across requests while keeping the state of the data.
- Data generated by the user is ensured to be assigned to that user only.
- Information can be stored in database or cookies.

**Cookies**

- HTTP is a stateless protocol, server doesn't preserve any info about the client.
- To store the client information, store it in a cookie or database.
- Cookies allow web app to retain information about the users. 
- Any subsequest request headers sent by the client will contain the cookie.
- Needs to encrypt cookies to protect the session.
- Types: 

  - **Session Cookies**

    - Non-persistent, only stored in the browser.
    - When browser is closed, cookies are deleted.

  - **Persistent Cookies**

    - Stay around even after the browser is closed.
    - Stored in the browser cache until they're deleted by the user.
    - Delete when user "Clear cookies", or when they pass the defined expiration date.

**Session Hijacking**

- Spoofing attack where host is disconnected and replaced by the attacker.
- Occurs through theft or modification of cookies.

**Session Prediction**

- Attacker attempts to predict session token to hijack the session.
- If token is predictable, they can be guessed, attackers can take over the session.

**Cookie Poisoning**

- Modifying the contents of the cookies to be sent to a client's browser.
- Modified cookie can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a web app

### Replay Attack

Attacker intercepts and retransmits a valid data transmission to trick the receiver into unauthorized actions, often impersonating one of the legitimate parties in the communication.

- Interception and retransmission of valid data packets.
- Unauthorized access, data manipulation, session hijacking.

**Mitigations**:

- Time-stamped tokens or nonces, ensures each transaction is unique and only valid for a short period.
- Use TLS/SSL to encrypt data and make interception more difficult.
- Mutual authentication techniques, validate each other's identities.
- Maintain a session or message log to track and verify unique transactions.
- Replay detection mechanisms to identify and block replayed messages.
- Use WPA3 to avoid replay attacks.

**Difference with Session Hijacking**

- Replay Attacks - attacker intercepts data, decides whether to retransmit it later.
- Session Hijacking - attacker alters data transmission in real-time.

    <library>    
      <book>
        <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
        <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
        <genre>Classic</genre>
        <year>1925</year>
      </book>
      
      <book>
        <title>To Kill a Mockingbird</title>
        <author>Harper Lee</author>
        <genre>Fiction</genre>
        <year>1960</year>
      </book>
    </library>
    ```

### XML Bomb

An XML bomb is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an XML document is crafted to consume excessive system resources when parsed by an XML parser.

- Recursive or nested elements designed to expand exponentially when parsed.
- XML encodes entities that expand to exponential sizes.
- Consumes large memory, CPU, or disk space when processed by an XML parser.
- Can lead to system downtime, service disruption, or unavailability.

The reason why its also called as **Billion Laughs Attack** is because the XML entities referenced in the file are written as "lol1" through "lol9". Each of these references the line before it, with the pattern continuing all the way up until it creates a billion "lols" due to the factorial nature.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE lol [
  <!ENTITY lol "lol">
  <!ENTITY lol1 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
  <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;">
  <!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
  <!ENTITY lol4 "&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;">
]>
<root>
  &lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;
</root>
```

Another form of XML Bomb:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE bomb [
  <!ENTITY a "1234567890">
  <!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;">
  <!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;">

</root>
 ```

**Mitigations**: 

- Use secure XML parsers.
- Limit entity expansion.
- Implement resource usage limits.


### XML External Entity

XML External Entity (XXE) allows an attacker to include external entities in an XML document, which can lead to information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or remote code execution. This vulnerability arises when an XML parser processes external entities defined within the document.

- Attackers embeds a request for a local resource.
- Read local files, perform SSRF attacks, or execute arbitrary code.
- Compromise of sensitive data, unauthorized access to resources, etc.

When the below XML document is processed by an XML parser, it attempts to resolve the xxe entity, resulting in the inclusion of the contents of the /etc/passwd file within the "username" element.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>
  <username>&xxe;</username>
</data>
```

**Mitigations**: 

- Disable external entity processing.
- Use secure XML parsers.

- Execution is masked as a legitimate process, evading security products.
- Stealthy execution of malicious code, evasion of security mechanisms, data theft.
- Monitoring for unusual process behavior, changes in process memory.

**Ways to inject code:**

- Injection through DLLs 
- Thread Execution Hijacking
- Process Hollowing
- Process Doppelganging
- Asynchronous Procedure Calls
- Portable Execution Injections

**Mitigations**:

- Unusual file access patterns, log entries showing traversal sequences like `../`.


How it looks like:


<div class="img-center">

![](/img/docs/sec+-directory-traversal.png)


</div>


**Hiding the traversal**

- Attackers can still hide traversal attempts by masking "../" with:

  ```bash
  %2e%2e%2f
  ```

**File Inclusion**

- Allows an attacker to download files or upload an executable for backdoor.
- Types:
  - **Remote File Inclusion**
    - Attacker executes a script to inject a remote file into the web app.
    
  - **Local File Inclusion**
    - Attacker tries to add a file that already exists.

**Mitigations**:

- Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure only safe characters are allowed.
- Secure APIs to abstract file paths and prevent direct access to the filesystem.
- Configure web server to disallow requests containing traversal sequences.
- Access controls restricting aaccess to sensitive files and directories.
- Regularly audit and monitor file system access logs for suspicious activities.

- **Fragmentation Limits**: Limit fragment size and count.
- **IDS/IPS**: Detect unusual fragmentation.
- **Secure Protocols**: Use protocols that handle fragmentation securely.

### Reverse Shell

A reverse shell is a malicious connection where the target machine initiates a connection to the attacker's machine, allowing remote control over the target system. This technique bypasses firewalls that block incoming connections but allow outbound ones.

- Attackers establish a connection from the victim's machine to their own, avoiding security controls.
- Methods include exploiting vulnerabilities or using social engineering to run malicious code.

Mitigation

  - Can capture sensitive information like passwords and personal data.

- **Introducing a Rogue Router/Switch**

  - Deploys unauthorized networking devices into the network.
  - Intercepts, manipulates, or redirects network traffic.
  - Can be used to capture data packets for analysis.
  - May disrupt legitimate network operations or degrade performance.


### Replaying the Attack 

Occurs when an attacker captures a valid data which is then repeated immediately or delayed and then repeated. See [Replay Attack.](#replay-attack)


<div class="img-center">

![](/img/docs/sec+-replaying-the-attack.png)


</div>


### Relaying the Attack 

Occurs when an attacker inserts themselves in between two hosts and become part of the conversation, and they can read or modify any any communications.


<div class="img-center">

![](/img/docs/sec+-relaying-the-attack.png)


</div>


### SSL Stripping 

If the server is using a strong encryption scheme like TLS 1.3, it's going to be difficult for an attacker to insert himself in between the two hosts. To overcome this, the attacker can use SSL stripping.

- Tricking the application to use HTTP instead of HTTPS connection.
- If it is impossible, attackers can resort to [downgrade attacks.](#downgrade-attacks)


## Layer 2 Attacks 

### ARP Cache Poisoning

ARP cache poisoning involves sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to a local network.

- Redirects traffic intended for one host to another host.
- Often used for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Can lead to data interception and unauthorized access.

Mitigations:

- Use static ARP cache entries. 
- Hosts should not accept ARP cache updates.
- Limit access to the network.

### MAC Address Flooding

MAC address flooding overwhelms a network switch with fake MAC addresses.

- Forces switch to broadcast traffic to all ports.
- Results in potential data exposure and network congestion.
- Used to intercept data in a switched network environment.

**Fail-open**

- When MAC flooding occurs, the network switch will simply fail open.
- When it fail-open, the switch begins to rebroadcast all traffic out to every port.


### Broadcast Storm

A broadcast storm occurs when a network is overwhelmed with continuous broadcast or multicast traffic.

- Also known as **Switching Loop**
- Can cause network congestion and slow down or crash the network.
- Often triggered by a loop in the network.
- Disrupts normal network communication.

Can be caused by:

- Faulty switch, network card ("jabber")
- Redundant links between switches

Mitigation:

- Configure STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) on the switch.

### Layer 2 Attack Mitigation

Mitigating Layer 2 attacks involves implementing various security measures.

- Enable port security to limit the number of MAC addresses per port.
- Employ MAC address filtering for network access.
- Use VLANs to segment and isolate network traffic.
- Implement Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) to prevent ARP spoofing.
- Use Static MAC Address assignments.
- Disable unused switch ports.
- Enable storm control to prevent broadcast storms.
- Configure STP and BPDU to prevent broadcast storms.
- Regularly update network devices to patch vulnerabilities.



## Driver Attacks

**Driver**:
A driver is software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices, enabling the functionality of peripherals such as printers, graphics cards, and network adapters.

**Driver Attacks**:
Driver attacks exploit vulnerabilities within these drivers to gain unauthorized access or control over a system, potentially leading to data breaches, system instability, and other security issues.

### Driver Shimming

Driver shimming involves inserting a layer of code between the operating system and the driver to intercept and modify its behavior.

- Used to add compatibility for older drivers or to monitor and log driver activities.
- Can be exploited to introduce malicious code or alter driver functions.
- May lead to system instability or unauthorized access.

### Driver Refactoring

Driver refactoring entails modifying the internal structure of driver code without changing its external behavior.

- Hidden malicious functionalities are added while preserving normal driver operations.
- Often used to bypass security mechanisms and avoid detection.
- Makes it challenging to identify malicious changes due to the subtle nature of modifications.


## Execution and Escalation

- **Execution**
  - Running arbitrary or remote code on a target system by exploiting vulnerabilities.

- **Escalation**
  - Increasing privileges to gain unauthorized access to higher-level resources.

### Arbitrary Code Execution

Arbitrary Code Execution is an attack where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary commands or code on a target machine.

- Exploitation of software vulnerabilities.
- Unauthorized actions on the target system.
- Monitoring for unusual or unexpected process activity.

**Mitigations**:

- Regularly update and patch software to fix known vulnerabilities.
- Employ input validation and sanitization.
- Use security-focused coding practices.
- Implement runtime protections like DEP and ASLR.

### Remote Code Execution

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is an attack where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities to run arbitrary code on a remote system (e.g. over the internet), often leading to complete system compromise.

- Exploitation of network-exposed vulnerabilities.
- Full control over the target system.
- Unusual network traffic and process activity.

**Mitigations**:

- Apply security patches and updates promptly.
- Disable unnecessary network services.
- Use firewalls to restrict network access.

### Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation is an attack where an attacker gains elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.

- Exploitation of software vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Unauthorized access to privileged information or functionality.
- Monitoring for changes in user permissions and role assignments.

**Types**:

- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**:
  - Attacker gains higher-level privileges than those initially granted.
  - Example: A normal user account exploiting a vulnerability to gain administrative or root access.

- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**:
  - Attacker accesses resources at same privilege level, but as another user.
  - Example: A user accessing another user’s account details without proper authorization.

**Mitigations**:

- Apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
- Regularly update and patch systems.
- Monitor and log access to critical systems and data.
- Use security tools to detect and prevent privilege escalation attempts.

### Rootkits

Rootkits are malicious software designed to hide the existence of certain processes or programs from normal methods of detection and enable continued privileged access to a computer.

- Modifies system files, often at the kernel level, to conceal its presence.
- Installing malicious software, often via compromised system components.
- Stealthy control over the infected system, difficult detection and removal.
- Anomalous system behavior, discrepancies in system and kernel data.

**Types**:

- **Kernel Mode**

  - Rootkits that operate at the kernel level of the operating system.
  - Gain deep access to system functions and resources.
  - Difficult to detect and remove due to their low-level nature.

- **User Mode**

  - Rootkits that operate at the user level of the operating system.
  - Manipulate system processes and user-level functions.
  - Easier to detect compared to kernel mode rootkits but still pose a significant threat to system security.

**Mitigations**:

- Use rootkit detection tools.
- Regularly update and patch operating systems and software.
- Implement robust access controls and monitoring.
- Conduct regular system integrity checks and audits.


## Overflow Attacks

Overflow attacks exploit the limits of data storage, leading to unexpected behavior in a program.

### Integer Overflow

Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value a variable can hold.

- Developers may allocate less memory than expected; can cause an application to crash.
- Can lead to erroneous calculations and unpredictable software behavior.
- Often used to bypass input validation or security checks.
- Scenarios where precise integer values are crucial, e.g. financial calculations, memory allocations.

Here's a [Wizardzines' comic diagram](https://wizardzines.com/comics/integer-overflow/) of how integer overflow works:

![](/img/docs/sec+-integer-overflow.png)

### Buffer Overflow Attack 

A Buffer Overflow attack involves sending malicious data to an application or system, causing it to crash or become unresponsive. 

- Takes advantage of programming errors in applications or systems.
- Allow attackers to send malicious data that exceeds the size of the allocated memory buffer.
- Causes the application or system to crash or become unresponsive.

**Buffer**

- A temporary storage area where a program stores its data.
- A program reserves a chunk of system memory when started up, this area is called a **stack.**
- Stacks stores the return addresses from function calls

**Smashing the Stack**

- Occurs when malicious code overwrites the return address.
- Attacker fills the buffer with **NOP** (Non-operation) instruction.
- **NOP Instruction** - tells the computer to do nothing and proceed to the next instruction.
- **NOP Slide** - NOPS is hit by non-malicious programs because buffer is already filled.
- The pointer now points to the area in the stack which contains the malicious code.
- It will "slide down" up to the last instruction, causing the pointer to branch out to the memory address where the malicious code is.

**Mitigations** 

- Implement strict checks for input length.
- Regularly audit code for vulnerabilities.
- Replace standard functions with bounds-checking alternatives.
- Deploy canaries for early detection of buffer overflows.
- Restrict code execution in specific memory areas.
- Keep software current to address vulnerabilities.
- Apply **ASLR** to randomize memory addresses.
  - ASLR or Address Space Layout Randomization
  - Prevents an attacker from guessing where the return pointer is.
  - Randomizes memory addresses, making buffer overflows attackers difficult. 
  - Can still be bypassed using sidechannel attacks.


### What is the Heartbleed Bug?

The Heartbleed bug is a flaw in the heartbeat extension of TLS and DTLS protocols which allows one computer to send a small amount of data to another computer to keep the connection alive and verify that the other computer is still responsive.

- A serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library.
- Discovered in April 2014 and is officially designated as CVE-2014-0160
- Affects the heartbeat extension implemented in OpenSSL, hence the name "Heartbleed."

**How it works:**

1. **Heartbeat Request**: 
   - A client sends a heartbeat request to the server, which includes a payload (a small piece of data) and specifies the payload's length.
   - For example, the client might send a request with a payload of 5 characters ("hello") and specify a length of 5.

2. **Server Response**:
   - The server is supposed to respond with the same payload and length, confirming that it received the request.

3. **Exploitation**:
   - The bug occurs because the server does not properly verify the length of the payload in the request. 
   - An attacker can send a malformed heartbeat request that specifies a much larger length than the actual payload. For example, the attacker could send a request with a payload of 1 character ("A") and specify a length of 65,535.
   - The server will then respond with the payload plus additional data from its memory buffer, up to the specified length.
   - This can result in the server inadvertently sending back sensitive data from its memory, including private keys, user passwords, session tokens, and other confidential information.

**Example Scenario:**

1. **Normal Heartbeat Request:**

  - Client: "hello" (5 bytes) with length field = 5
  - Server: "hello" (5 bytes)

2. **Malicious Heartbeat Request:**

  - Attacker: "A" (1 byte) with length field = 65,535
  - Server: "A" followed by up to 65,534 bytes of adjacent memory data

**Mitigation and Response:**

- **Patch OpenSSL**: 
  - Updating OpenSSL to a version that patches the Heartbleed bug (versions 1.0.1g and later) is crucial.

- **Reissue Certificates**: 
  - After patching, affected organizations should revoke and reissue SSL/TLS certificates, as private keys may have been compromised.

- **Change Passwords**: 
  - Users should change passwords for any accounts that may have been accessed during the period the vulnerability was exploitable.

- **Monitor for Attacks**: 
  - Implement monitoring solutions to detect unusual activity that might indicate exploitation of the vulnerability.


## Other Attacks 

### Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, allowing the attackers to circumvent the browser's security model or trusted zones.

- Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages.
- Scripts execute in the context of the victim's browser (client-side)
- Allows session hijacking, data theft, defacement.
- Exploitations include phishing attacks, cookie theft, form manipulation.

**Steps in an XSS Attack:**

1. Attacker identifies input validation vulnerability within a trusted website.
2. Attacker crafts a URL to perform code injection against the trusted website.
3. URL is posted or embedded to an email to get somebody to click it.
4. Trusted site returns a page containing the injected malicious code.
5. Malicious code is ran in client's browser with permission level of trusted site.


**Types**: 

- **Reflected XSS**
  - Malicious script is part of the request sent to the server.
  - Server includes the script in the response, reflecting it back to the user.
  - Commonly found in search queries, error messages, or URL parameters.
  
- **Persistent XSS**
  - Malicious script is stored in the web application's database.
  - Executed whenever the compromised data is retrieved and displayed to users.
  - More dangerous as it affects all users who access the compromised data.

- **Non-persistent XSS**
  - Malicious script is injected into a web page, but it's only reflected back to the current user.
  - Often found in input fields or URL parameters.
  - Requires social engineering to trick users into visiting a specially crafted link.

- **Stored XSS**
  - Similar to persistent XSS, but the injected script is stored permanently on the server.
  - Can affect multiple users accessing the compromised data.
  - Commonly found in comment sections, message boards, or user profiles.

- **DOM-based XSS**
  - Document Object Model or DOM.
  - Client-side JavaScript code manipulates DOM, leads to execution of scripts.
  - Script execution happens within the victim's browser, without involving the server.
  - Difficult to detect and mitigate compared to server-side XSS vulnerabilities.
  - Examples of code snippets that can be used to affect the DOM:

    ```JavaScript
    document.cookie 
    document.write 
    document.location 
    ```

**Mitigations**:

- Use input validation libraries or frameworks to enforce strict input requirements.
- Encode output data before displaying in web pages, prevents execution of malicious code.
- HTML escaping functions or libraries to encode special characters into their respective HTML entities.

    ```bash
    <, >, &, etc. 
    ```

- Regular security audits/code reviews, identify and fix XSS vulnerabilities in web apps.
- Automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques to detect and remediate XSS issues.
- Raise awareness onsafe coding practices, input validation, and output encoding techniques.
- Implement the following:

  - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
    - Restrict the types of content that can be loaded and executed on web pages.
    - Specify allowed sources for scripts, stylesheets, and other resources.

  - **HTTPOnly and Secure Cookies**:
    - Prevents access from client-side scripts, reducing the risk of session hijacking.
    - "Secure" flag ensures cookies are only transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections.

  - **XSS Protection Headers**:
    - Features like X-XSS-Protection to detect and mitigate XSS attacks.
    - Block or sanitize pages when potential XSS vulnerabilities are detected.
  


### Cross-Site Request Forgery

Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) is a malicious script host on the attacker's site which is used to exploit a session started on another site within the same web browser. The attacker needs to convince the victim to start a session with the targeted website.

- Manipulation of session cookies, user impersonation.
- Users are tricked into executing malicious actions without their consent.
- Form submissions, image requests, API calls.
- Exploits the trust relationship between the user and the web application.
- Impact include account takeover, unauthorized transactions.

**Mitigations**:

- Use of user-specific CSRF tokens in all form submissions.
- Add randomness and prompt for additional information.
- Require users to enter current password when changing their password.
- Use Web application firewalls (WAFs).

### Server-side Request Forgery

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests from a server they control or manipulate, exploiting the server's network interaction capabilities.

- Typically involves manipulating the server to route requests internally.
- Security controls are bypassed by leveraging server’s trust to make internal requests.
- Accessing sensitive data, exploiting services, or unauthorized actions.
- Data breaches, service disruptions, or unauthorized data manipulation.

**Mitigations**:

- Rigorously validate input data, especially URLs and addresses.
- Prevent user-supplied data in URLs used for server-side requests.
- Limit access to internal services from the server.
- Apply security policies to control server interactions.
- Use network segmentation to isolate internal networks.
- Implement firewalls and access control lists (ACLs).
- Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring.

### Side Channel Attacks 

Side channel attacks exploit unintended information leakage from a system's physical implementation, such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing variations.

Examples: Timing attacks, power analysis attacks, and electromagnetic analysis attacks.

**Mitigations** 

- Constant-time algorithms, noise injection, and secure hardware design.
- This countermeasures reduce the risk of information leakage from side channels. 
- Regularly update and patch systems to address potential vulnerabilities.
