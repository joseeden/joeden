## Bluejacking

Bluejacking involves sending unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. These messages usually appear as notifications or contact information and are typically harmless.

- An attacker uses a Bluetooth device to scan for nearby devices.
- Messages are sent via the Bluetooth "contact" feature.
- Recipients receive unexpected notifications.
- Typically harmless but can be used for spam or pranks.

## Bluesnarfing

Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access to information on a Bluetooth-enabled device through a Bluetooth connection. Attackers can retrieve sensitive data such as contacts, messages, and emails.

- Attackers scan for discoverable Bluetooth devices.
- Exploits vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth connection process.
- Specialized software exploits Bluetooth protocol vulnerabilities.
- Can lead to stolen contact lists, messages, and other sensitive information.

## Bluebugging

Bluebugging allows attackers to gain control over a Bluetooth-enabled device. They can perform actions like making calls, sending messages, or accessing data remotely.

- Advanced bluesnarfing.
- Exploits vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth protocol.
- Allows remote control of a Bluetooth-enabled device without the owner's consent.
- Attackers can make calls, send messages, and access other device functions.

## Bluesmack

Bluesmack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that overwhelms Bluetooth-enabled devices, causing them to become unresponsive.

- Attackers send a large number of malicious packets to the target device.
- The device's resources get overwhelmed and become slow or crash.
- Results in temporary or permanent denial of service.

## Blueborne

Blueborne exploits vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth protocol, allowing attackers to take complete control of a device without any user interaction. It can lead to full device compromise and data theft.

- Attackers scan for Bluetooth-enabled devices.
- Exploits Blueborne vulnerabilities for remote code execution.
- Allows malware to spread via Bluetooth without user interaction.
- Unauthorized data access, device takeover, and further malware distribution.

## Mitigation Strategies

To protect against these Bluetooth attacks:

- Keep Bluetooth off when not in use.
- Use non-discoverable mode to prevent unauthorized scanning.
- Update devices regularly for the latest security patches.
- Pair devices only with trusted sources.
- Monitor Bluetooth connections for unusual activity.
- Use encryption and strong authentication mechanisms where possible.
