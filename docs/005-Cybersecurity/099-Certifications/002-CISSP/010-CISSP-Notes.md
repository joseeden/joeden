## CPE 

Each year to keep your certification current you need to earn a certain amount of CPE's. You can either do purely group A CPE's or chose to do up to 10 group B CPE's per year.

Earning CPE: 
 
- Earn 40 CPE per year OR 120 CPE per 3 years 
- To earn the CPE units, you need 40 hours of IT Security:

    - Training 
    - Webinar 
    - Seminar 

- You can present certificate of completions when applying for renewal
- If there's no completion certs, you can present materials or resources you created to prove the training.

Types of CPEs:

- **Group A Credits: Domain-Related Activities**

    - Group A credits relate directly to the cyber security profession. 
    - Generally, activities in the areas covered by the specific domains of the respective credential.
    - No maximum annual CPE  - you can accumulate as much CPE as you want.

- **Group B Credits: Professional Development/Knowledge Sharing**

    - Group B credits are earned for completion of general professional development activities which enhance your overall professional skills, education, knowledge, or competency outside of the domains associated with the respective certifications. 
    - These generally include professional development programs, such as management courses. 
    - While these do not apply directly to the domains, (ISC)² recognizes these skills are vital in the growth of all professionals and their credentials.
    - Max of 10 CPE per year
