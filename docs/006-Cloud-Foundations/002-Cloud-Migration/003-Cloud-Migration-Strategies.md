## Overview

Below are the  common strategies used when discussing Cloud Migration projects. 

- [Rehost Lift and Shift](#rehost-lift-and-shift)
- [Replatform Modify Lift and Shift](#replatform-modify-lift-and-shift)
- [Repurchase Drop and Shop](#repurchase-drop-and-shop)
- [Refactor Rearchitect](#refactor-rearchitect)
- [Retain Hybrid or Part Migration](#retain-hybrid-or-part-migration)

A few notes:

- These strategies are not definitive or mutually exclusive, providing flexibility for unique migration scenarios.
- They serve as guidelines and discussion starters, adapting as needed during Cloud transformation workshops or brainstorming sessions.
- A migration project may involve elements of multiple strategies at various stages, tailored to specific business needs


## Rehost (Lift and Shift)

- Definition: Lift servers or applications from the current environment and shift them to the public Cloud.
- Benefits: Quick migration, scalability, and pay-as-you-go infrastructure.
- Use Case: Ideal for organizations starting their migration journey, especially when facing fixed constraints or deadlines.

## Replatform (Modify Lift and Shift)

- Definition: Make optimizations to the application during the migration stage.
- Benefits: Improves efficiency and performance during migration.
- Use Case: Appropriate when some adjustments can enhance application functionality during the move.

## Repurchase (Drop and Shop)

- Definition: Move to another product or service, often involving a change in licensing or platform.
- Benefits: Useful when transitioning from a proprietary database or product.
- Use Case: Applied when existing services are not compatible with Cloud infrastructure.

## Refactor (Rearchitect)

- Definition: Rearchitect the application, often driven by a need for immediate improvements in services.
- Benefits: Enhances availability, reliability, and meets specific security or compliance requirements.
- Use Case: Applicable when a strong desire to improve services is a driving factor.

## Retain (Hybrid or Part Migration)

- Definition: Keep certain aspects of the IT portfolio on-premise due to readiness concerns or regulatory requirements.
- Benefits: Allows for a phased migration while complying with specific rules or constraints.
- Use Case: Relevant when regulatory or constitutional rules necessitate on-premise storage or operation.

## Retire (Turn Off Services)

- Definition: Identify and turn off assets and services to focus on widely used and valuable business services.
- Benefits: Streamlines business focus and resource allocation.
- Use Case: Helpful in eliminating redundant or low-value services to optimize resources.
