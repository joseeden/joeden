## Coaxial Cabling 

Coaxial cabling is a type of electrical cable used primarily in radio frequency (RF) communications, television, and satellite systems. It is known for its superior performance in high-frequency signal transmission compared to twisted-pair cables.

- Higher performance than twisted-pair cables, used in RF communication.
- Shielded and commonly used for cable television and satellite.
- More resistant to interference and signal degradation over long distances.

### Characteristics

Coaxial cables offer specific characteristics that make them suitable for certain environments where resistance to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) is critical.

- More resistant to EMI and RFI than twisted-pair.
- More expensive than twisted-pair but allows for longer Ethernet segments.
- Copper core carries multiple analog signals, also known as broadband.
- Can transmit greater bandwidth and over longer distances than twisted-pair.


### Types of Coax Cables

- **Thinnet**
  - Flexible, used for short-distance Ethernet networks
  - Easy to install but prone to damage

- **Unshielded Twisted-pair (UTP)**
  - Lacks additional shielding, making it cheaper and easier to install
  - Most common in home and office networks

## Copper Media Issues 

Copper cabling can suffer from various issues that affect signal quality.

- **Noise**
  - Corrupts binary signals and causes data errors
  - Sources include EMI and RFI from nearby electrical equipment

- **Attenuation**
  - Signal loss over long distances
  - Requires repeaters or amplifiers for long cable runs

- **Cross Talk**
  - Signal interference between adjacent wires
  - UTP is more vulnerable than shielded options like STP

## Wiring Closets 

Wiring closets are essential for organizing network cables and devices.

- Patch panels serve as the connection points for cables coming from wall jacks.
- Houses networking equipment like switches, routers, and servers for easy access.

## Fiber Optic Cables 

Fiber optic cables are high-speed transmission media that use light to transmit data, offering greater bandwidth and distance capabilities than traditional copper cables. These cables are commonly used in backbone networks, long-distance communications, and high-speed data transfer.

- Transmit data as light signals through glass or plastic fibers.
- Immune to electromagnetic and radio frequency interference.
- Cover longer distances than copper cables.
- Provide higher bandwidth and faster transmission rates.
- Extremely resitant to eavesdropping and interference, but expensive.

### Fiber Modes

- **Single Mode**
    - Uses a single light path for data transmission.
    - Suitable for long-distance communication, up to hundreds of kilometers.
    - Typically used in telecom networks and large-scale data centers.

- **Multi-Mode**
    - Multiple light paths transmit data simultaneously.
    - Effective for shorter distances, typically up to 2 kilometers.
    - Commonly used in local area networks (LANs) and within buildings.

### Fiber Connectors

- **Subscriber Connector (SC)**
    - Widely used in telecommunications and data networks.
    - Push-pull coupling mechanism for easy connection and disconnection.

- **Lucent Connector (LC)**
    - Smaller footprint, allowing for higher density connections.
    - Uses latch mechanism similar to RJ45 connectors for secure locking.

## Network LAN Topologies 

Network LAN topologies define the arrangement of devices and how they connect to each other. Understanding these configurations helps in optimizing performance and troubleshooting issues.

- **Bus Topology**
    - All devices share a single communication line or cable.
    - Simple to set up but can lead to network failure if the main cable fails.

- **Ring Topology**
    - Each device is connected in a circular fashion.
    - Data travels in one direction; failure in one device can disrupt the entire network.

- **Star Topology**
    - All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
    - Offers high reliability; failure of one device doesnâ€™t affect others.

- **Tree Topology**
    - Combines characteristics of star and bus topologies.
    - Hierarchical structure allows for easy expansion but can be complex to manage.

- **Mesh Topology**
    - Each device connects to multiple other devices.
    - Provides high redundancy and reliability, but can be costly to implement due to cable requirements.
