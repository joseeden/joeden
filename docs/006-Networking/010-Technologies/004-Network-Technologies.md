## Token Ring

A LAN technology where devices share access to the network by passing a token.

- Nodes pass a token to control which device can send data
- Reduces collisions compared to early Ethernet
- Mostly replaced by Ethernet but still used in some legacy environments


## SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)

A high-speed fiber-optic network standard widely used in long-distance telecommunication.

- Supports long-distance data transport with precise timing
- Provides synchronous, reliable, and high-capacity channels
- Often used by carriers for backbone networks and multiplexing multiple signals


## ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)

A WAN technology designed for high-speed transmission of voice, video, and data.

- Uses fixed 53-byte cells for low latency and predictable performance
- Supports multiple traffic types simultaneously (voice, video, data)
- Connection-oriented, suitable for QoS-sensitive applications


## Frame Relay

A packet-switched WAN technology for connecting multiple sites efficiently.

- Uses variable-length frames to carry data over shared networks
- Efficient for bursty traffic with minimal overhead
- Error checking is minimal, relying on endpoints for reliability
- Often used for connecting branch offices over leased lines


## X.25

An older packet-switched WAN protocol with strong error correction.

- Provides reliable delivery over potentially noisy links
- Slower compared to modern WAN technologies like Frame Relay or MPLS
- Uses extensive error control, flow control, and acknowledgments
- Mostly phased out but influenced later WAN protocols


## FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)

A high-speed LAN technology using fiber-optic cabling in a ring topology.

- Uses token passing to control access and reduce collisions
- Supports speeds up to 100 Mbps with dual-ring redundancy
- Used in campus networks and backbone connections before Gigabit Ethernet
