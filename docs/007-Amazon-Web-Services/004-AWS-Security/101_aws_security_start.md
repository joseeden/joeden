## First Steps on Securing your AWS account

- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Enable Cloudtrail for auditing 
- Use IAM for every future action 

 ## AWS Own Security Practices 

Resources:

- [AWS Cloud Security Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)
- [AWS Cloud Compliance Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/)

    - PCi 
    - DSS Compliant
    - ISO 27001
    - HIPAA


## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

- AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud 
- customer is responsible for the security "in" the cloud

**Security of the Cloud**

- Protection of infrastructure that run all the offered services 
- Hardware, software, networking, and facilities 
- Software services provided by AWS (Managed services)

**Security in the Cloud**

- Responsibility and management of:
    - guest OS of EC2 compute instances
    - other application software
    - configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall 

AWS categorized the services into three:

## AWS Config 

Records and evaluate configurations of your AWS resources.

- assess, audiit, and evaluate configurations 
- continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations 
- allows to automate evaluation of recorded configurations against their desired configurations

## AWS CloudTrail 

Track user activity and API usage.

- enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, adn risk auditing og your AWS account
- log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure
- provides event history of your AWS account activity

## Data Control 

How data is being encrypted.

- **AWS KMS**
    - Multi-tenant
    - Shared service 

- **AWS CloudHSM**
    - Dedicated cluster where you can store encrytion keys
    - Isolation up to the physical layer
    - Strong compliance requirement
