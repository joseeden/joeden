This is not an exhaustive documentation of all the existing AWS Services. These are summarized notes that I used for the AWS Certifications.

## Disaster 

- Disaster: any event that has a negative impact on a company's business continuity or finances.
- Disaster Recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster.
- Disaster recovery solutions:
    - On-premise to on-premise: traditional DR, expensive
    - On-premise to cloud: hybrid recovery
    - AWS Cloud Region A to AWS Cloud Region B

## RPO and RTO

- **RPO** - Recovery Point Objective: How often we create backups. Time between the RPO and the disaster is the data loss.
- **RTO** - Recovery Time Objective: The point in time when the recovery finishes. The time between the disaster and the RTO is downtime.


## Disaster Recovery Strategies

All strategies are available for Multi-region. 

- **Backup and Restore**

  - High RPO, cheap, easy to manage and accomplish.

- **Pilot Light**

  - A small version of the app is always running in the cloud.
  - Useful for critical core (pilot light).
  - Similar to backup and restore strategy.
  - Faster than backup and restore as critical system are already running.

- **Warm Standby**

  - Full system is up and running but at a minimal size.
  - Upon disaster we can scale to production load.

- **Hot Site / Multi Site Approach**

  - Very low RTO - very expensive.
  - Full production scale is running on the cloud.

## Disaster Recovery Tips

-**Backups**

    - EBS Snapshots, RDS, automated backups, snapshots, etc.
    - Regular pushes to S3/S3 IA/Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross region replication.
    - From on-premise: Snowball or Storage Gateway.

-**High Availability**

    - Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from region to region.
    - RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3.
    - Site to site VPN as recovery from Direct Connect.

-**Replication**

    - RDS Replication (Cross Region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases.
    - Database replication from on-premise to RDS.
    - Storage Gateway.

-**Automation**

    - CloudFormation/Elastic Beanstalk to recreate a whole new environment.
    - Recover/Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarm is in fail state (ALARM).
    - AWS Lambda for customized automation.

-**Chaos**

    - Netflix has a "simian-army" randomly terminating EC2 instances.



## On-Premise Strategy with AWS

- **Download Amazon Linux 2 AMI as a VIM**

    - iso format.
    - VMWare, KVM, VirtualBox, Microsoft Hyper-V.

- **VM Import/Export**

    - Ability to migrate existing applications into EC2.
    - Ability to create a DR repository for on-premise VMs.
    - Ability to export back the VMs form EC2 to on-premise.

- **AWS Application Discovery Service**

    - Gather information about on-premise servers to plan a migration.
    - Provides information about server utilization and dependency mappings.
    - Track all migrations with AWS Migration Hub.

- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**

    - Replicate on-premise.
    - Works with various DB technologies.

- **AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)**

    - Incremental replication of on-premise live servers to AWS.



## Database Migration Service (DMS)

- Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS.
- It is resilient and self healing.
- The source database remains available during migration.
- Supports:
    - Homogeneous migrations, example Oracle to Oracle.
    - Heterogeneous migrations, example: Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora.
- Supports continuous data replication using CDC.
- We must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks.

### DMS Sources and Targets

|![](/img/docs/aws-schematool-howitworksss.png)|
|-|

- **Sources**
  - On-premise and EC2 instance databases: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SAP, DB2
  - Azure SQL Database
  - Amazon RDS: all including Aurora
  - Amazon S3

- **Targets**
  - On-premise and EC2 instance databases: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, AP
  - Amazon RDS
  - Redshift
  - DynamoDB
  - S3
  - ElasticSearch
  - Kinesis Data Streams
  - DocumentDB

  


## AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

- Converts a database schema form one engine to another. Example: OLTP (SQL Server, Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora; OLAP (Teradata or Oracle) to Redshift
- We do not need to use SCT if we are migration from the same DB engine to the same DB engine
