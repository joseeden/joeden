## PCI DSS 

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** is a set of standards to protect credit card data during processing, storage, or transmission.

- Applies to all businesses that handle credit card transactions
- Requires strong security measures like encryption and access control
- Non-compliance can result in fines or losing the ability to process payments

Failing an internal PCI DSS compliance assessment typically results in **audit findings**, which are documented issues that need to be addressed to achieve compliance. These findings highlight areas where the bank's security practices do not meet the required standards and must be remediated.

The **chief information security officer (CISO)** focuses on information security and risk management within the company but does not primarily serve as the liaison for GDPR compliance.
