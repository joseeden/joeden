## Overview

Zero Trust is a security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether inside or outside the organization, should be trusted by default and verification is required for everybody.

## Control Plane
Define, manage, and enforce the policies related to user and system access 

- **Adaptive identity** - rely on real-time validation.
- **Threat scope reduction** - limit user's access to only what they need.
- **Policy-driven access control** - enforce user access policies based on their roles
- **Secured zones** - isolated environments within a network that is designed to house sensitive data.

## Data Plane
Ensures that the policies and procedures are properly executed.

- **Subject/system** - individual or entity attempting to gain access.
- **Policy engine** - cross-references the access request with its pre-defined policies.
- **Policy administrator** - establish and manage the access policies.
- **Policy enforcement points** - acts as gatekeeper which allow or restrict access.
