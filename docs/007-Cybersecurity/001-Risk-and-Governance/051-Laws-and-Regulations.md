## Categories of Laws in the US  

### Criminal Law

Criminal law consists of statutes and rules that define offenses against society, with penalties such as fines, imprisonment, or other punishments.

- Enforced by police and law enforcement agencies
- Prohibits acts like murder, assault, robbery, and arson
- Covers cybercrimes such as hacking, data breaches, and unauthorized system access
- Unique feature is punishment, often involving loss of liberty
- Must be established by legislative bodies at national, state, or local levels

All federal and state laws must comply with the ultimate authority that dictates how the US system of government works - the US Constitution

### Civil Law

Also called **Tort Law**, civil law handles disputes between individuals or organizations where the goal is compensation or specific action, not criminal punishment.

- Covers almost any matter that is not addressed by criminal law.
- This includes liability claims, estate probate, contractual disputes, etc.
- Passed by legislative bodies but does not impose jail time

Like criminal law, civil laws go through the legislative process and must comply with constitutional limits. At the federal level, both are contained in the United States Code (USC).

The main difference between civil law and criminal law lies in who brings the case and the type of penalty.

In a criminal prosecution:

- Goal is to prove guilt and impose punishment
- The government prosecutes the accused
- Penalties include fines, probation, or imprisonment

In civil matters:

- Goal is compensation or action
- The injured party (plaintiff) files the case
- Outcomes are usually monetary damages or court orders


### Administrative Law

Administrative law governs the activities of administrative agencies of government. 

- Often provide details missing from the law.
- Defines regulatory requirements set by government agencies.
- Specifies standards and procedures for compliance audits.
- Enforces penalties or fines for non-compliance with regulatory standards.

At the federal level, administrative law is found in the **Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**

## Private Regulations

Private regulations refer to rules and standards established by non-governmental entities, such as industry associations or professional bodies. 

- Industry-specific standards for data protection and cybersecurity.
- Requires adherence to codes of conduct and ethical guidelines.
- Provides frameworks for self-regulation and certification programs
- An example is the PCI-DSS credit card processing compliance.

## Fourth Amendment

The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Key aspects include:

- **Protection Against Unlawful Searches** 
   
   It establishes the principle that individuals have a right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures of their electronic data by government entities.
  
- **Requirement for Warrants** 
  
  Law enforcement must obtain warrants based on probable cause before conducting searches of electronic devices, accessing private communications, or seizing digital information.
  
- **Impact on Digital Privacy** 
  
  Shapes legal interpretations and discussions regarding the privacy rights of individuals concerning their electronic communications, data stored in the cloud, and digital devices.


## The Federal Privacy Act of 1974

A U.S. federal law designed to protect personal information held by government agencies.

- Regulates the collection, maintenance, and use of personal data
- Ensures transparency and privacy protections for U.S. citizens


## Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

Originally introduced in 1984 as the **Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act**, it was amended in 1986 and became the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**. This U.S. federal law protects computer systems and data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

- Prohibits unauthorized access to computers and networks
- Covers crimes such as hacking and fraud
- Imposes penalties for computer-related offenses

Congress first attempted to address computer crime under the **Comprehensive Crime Control Act (CCCA) of 1984**, but the CFAA was written specifically for crimes that crossed state lines, avoiding conflicts with state laws.

The CFAA applies to:

- Computers used by the U.S. government
- Computers used by financial institutions
- Cases where offenses disrupt government or financial systems
- Computers involved in crimes spanning multiple states


## Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986

A U.S. federal law that strengthens privacy protections for electronic communications and complements other information security laws.

While both address computers and electronic data, **CFAA** and **ECPA** serve different purposes:

- **CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)**

  - Targets **computer crimes**
  - Prohibits unauthorized access, hacking, and cyber fraud
  - Violations lead to **criminal penalties**

- **ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act)**

  - Protects **privacy of electronic communications**
  - Secures emails, calls, and other electronic data from interception
  - Violations can result in **civil or criminal penalties**
  - Focus is on privacy, not system damage

**Summary:**

- **CFAA = crime prevention and punishment**
- **ECPA = privacy protection**


## Computer Security Act of 1987

The **Computer Security Act of 1987** is a US federal law aimed at improving the security of federal computer systems and protecting sensitive information.

- Sets requirements for securing federal computer systems
- Requires protection of sensitive but unclassified information
- Ffederal agencies to develop security plans and training programs for staff

While CFAA address computer crimes, this act emphasizes preventive security measures to reduce risks.

## NIIPA of 1996

An amendment to the CFAA, the **National Information Infrastructure Protection Act (NIIPA) of 1996** expanded its scope and protections.

- Extended coverage to computer systems used in international commerce, not just interstate
- Included critical infrastructure beyond computers, such as railroads, pipelines, and power grids
- Made intentional or reckless damage to national infrastructure a felony

## FISMA of 2002

The **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)**, passed in 2002 under the **Electronic Government Act**, sets standards for securing federal information and systems. It provides a framework for managing cybersecurity risks across government agencies.

- Strengthens federal agency cybersecurity
- Requires use of a *Risk Management Framework (RMF)*
- Mandates security controls defined by NIST
- Requires annual security program reports

FISMA places a significant burden on federal agencies and government contractors, who must develop and maintain substantial documentation of their FISM compliant activities.


## FISMA of 2014 

The **Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014** updated FISMA to tackle evolving cybersecurity threats and strengthen federal security practices. It also enhanced  **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** role in overseeing federal cybersecurity.

Exceptions to DHS oversight:

1. Defense-related cybersecurity remains under the Secretary of Defense
2. Intelligence-related cybersecurity remains under the Director of National Intelligence


## Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014

A U.S. federal law focused on improving cybersecurity research, standards, and education. Amended in 2022, it strengthens federal cybersecurity efforts and promotes development of best practices.

NIST produces the 800 series of Special Publications for guidance on information security and privacy.

- **NIST SP 800-53**

  - Security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations
  - Provides a framework for risk management
  - Guides implementation of technical and administrative safeguards

- **NIST SP 800-171**

  - Protects Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations
  - Specifies security requirements for contractors handling federal data
  - Helps ensure consistent safeguarding of sensitive information

## National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 

The **National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014** established the **National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)** within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The NCCIC serves as a central hub for sharing cybersecurity information and coordinating responses to cyber threats.


## Federal Information and Resources Management Regulation

A U.S. regulation that sets rules for the use and management of federal information resources.

- Governs how federal agencies manage information resources
- Ensures security and efficiency in resource use
