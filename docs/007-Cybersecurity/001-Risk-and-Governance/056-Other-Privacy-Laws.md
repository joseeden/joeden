## GDPR (EU)

The **European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** applies to all organizations processing the personal data of individuals residing in the EU, regardless of the organization's location.

Under GDPR, the **data protection officer (DPO)** ensures that the company understands its privacy responsibilities and serving as the primary liaison to the supervising authority. 

The **chief information security officer (CISO)** focuses on information security and risk management within the company but does not primarily serve as the liaison for GDPR compliance.
