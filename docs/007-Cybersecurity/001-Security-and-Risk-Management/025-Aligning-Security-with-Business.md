## Overview

Security is crucial for protecting sensitive data, ensuring regulatory compliance, maintaining customer trust, and safeguarding organizational assets. Balancing security with other organizational missions, such as profitability and innovation, is essential for long-term success.

## Wearing Two Hats

In an organization, leaders often need to balance dual roles to achieve overall success. This is especially true for those in security roles, who must integrate security considerations with business objectives.

## Building a Business Case

A well-constructed business case helps stakeholders understand the value and necessity of investing in security measures. It outlines the benefits, costs, and impact on the organization, making it easier to gain support and funding for security projects.
