## Vendor Information Management

When working with vendors, organizations must ensure that vendors handle customer data with utmost care, especially concerning data ownership and protection. Vendor agreements should contain clear language about data ownership and usage.

- Customer retains uninhibited data ownership.
- Vendor's right to use information is limited to activities performed on behalf of the customer.
- Vendor's right to use information is limited to activities performed with the customer's knowledge.
- Vendor must delete information at the end of the contract.

Another crucial area is data sharing. Agreements should include language that prohibits the vendor from sharing customer information with third parties without explicit consent from the customer.

Finally, agreements should contain data protection provisions.

- Important if the vendor is the sole custodian of critical information belonging to the customer.
- Contracts should specify that the vendor is responsible for preserving information.
- Vendor must implement appropriate fault tolerance and backup procedures to prevent data loss.
