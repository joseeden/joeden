## Data States 

Data can exist in different states depending on how it is being handled or stored. 

### Data at Rest

Data stored in a physical location, such as a hard drive, database, or cloud storage. 

- Vulnerable to physical theft or unauthorized access
- Targeted by attacks that compromise storage systems.
- Nt actively moving or being transferred between systems.
- Protected by physical security, access controls, and monitoring.

### Data in Use

Data currently being processed, manipulated, or accessed by an application or user.

- Includes data analyzed by software or accessed by users
- Vulnerable to unauthorized access, memory exploits, and insider threats
- Protected by application security, authentication, authorization
- Other methods: data masking, and memory protection techniques (e.g., ASLR)

### Data in Transit

Data actively moving between locations or systems, such as over networks, between servers, or through communication channels.

- Sent via email, the internet, or communication between networked devices.
- Data remains unreadable without the proper decryption key. 
- TLS (Transport Layer Security) and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) 
- Data in transit is susceptible to interception and eavesdropping. 


## Data Types 

### By Nature

- **Structured Data**

  - Organized in a defined format, like tables or databases
  - Elements are easily identifiable
  - Example: Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases

- **Unstructured Data**

  - No specific format or structure
  - Harder to organize and analyze
  - Example: Text documents, emails, images

- **Semi-structured Data**

  - Partially organized, often with metadata
  - Not fully structured like databases
  - Example: JSON, XML

### By Format

- **Text Data**
    - Information stored in a text-based format
    - Example: documents, emails, or code.

- **Numeric Data**
    -  Data represented by numbers
    -  Financial data, statistics, or sensor readings.

- **Binary Data**
    -  Data represented in binary form
    -  Includes computer files, images, videos, or audio.


### By Use

- **Operational Data**
    -  Data used in day-to-day operations, like customer records
    -  Example: Sales transactions, or inventory information.

- **Analytical Data**
    -  Data used for analysis and business intelligence
    -  Often derived from operational data.

- **Master Data**
    -  Core business data that is consistent across different systems
    -  Example: Customer or product information.

- **Metadata**
    -  Data about data
    -  Provides information on the properties of data.

### By Origin

- **Primary Data**

  - Collected directly from original sources
  - Example: Surveys, experiments, direct observations

- **Secondary Data**

  - Derived from existing sources
  - Example: Reports, studies, databases


### By Sensitivity

- **Non-sensitive Data**

  - Low-risk or public information
  - Does not require strict security measures

- **Sensitive Data**
    - Requires special protection due to privacy or security concernS
    - Examples:

        - **Regulated data**

            - Covered by legal regulations
            - Subject to privacy rules

        - **Trade secrets**

            - Confidential information
            - Critical to business competitiveness

        - **Intellectual property**

            - Valuable creations
            - Requires protection from theft or misuse

        - **Legal information**

            - Confidential matters
            - Includes attorney-client communications

        - **Financial information**

            - Sensitive financial details
            - Protects against fraud and identity theft
