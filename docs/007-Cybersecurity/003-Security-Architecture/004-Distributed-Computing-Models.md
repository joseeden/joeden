## Client/Server Model  
The client/server model is a common computing architecture where a central server processes requests from multiple client machines.

- Central server handles client requests  
- Clients request actions like data retrieval or calculations  
- Example: web browsers (clients) requesting web pages from servers  

## Distributed Computing  
In distributed computing, many systems share the responsibility of processing large tasks by working on smaller pieces simultaneously.

- Divides tasks among multiple systems  
- Efficient for solving large-scale problems  
- Example: SETI project using home computers to search for extraterrestrial life  

## Grid Computing  
Grid computing uses a centralized system to coordinate the resources of many individual computers to work on a single task.

- Creates a virtual supercomputer  
- Centralized controller assigns tasks to grid members  
- Useful for large data processing  

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Computing  
P2P computing is a distributed model where systems collaborate to offer services to each other, often without a central controller.

- No central authority, all nodes are equal  
- Examples: BitTorrent, Bitcoin, Tor network  

## Security Concerns with Distributed Computing  
Distributed computing models introduce specific security risks due to their decentralized nature.

- Risk of sharing sensitive information with untrusted nodes  
- Malicious users could gain control of participant systems  
- P2P networks may expose users to illegal activities
