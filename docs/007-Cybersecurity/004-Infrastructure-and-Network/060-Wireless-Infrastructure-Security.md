## Securing WAPs

Wireless access points (WAPs) extend a wireless network's coverage by broadcasting a signal from a wired connection. For more information, please see [WAPs.](/docs/006-Networking/001-The-Basics/060-Wireless-Networking.md)

To keep WAPs secure:

- Use strong encryption like WPA3.
- Keep firmware updated to fix known issues.
- Set unique, strong passwords and disable default settings.
- Enable MAC filtering to control which devices can connect.
- Watch network traffic for anything unusual.
- Place WAPs where theyâ€™re harder to access physically.


## WAP Placement

The positioning of the WAPs will significantly impact the range, coverage, and signal strength of your organization's wireless network.

- Put WAPs in central locations for better coverage and fewer dead spots.
- Avoid placing them near outside walls to limit signal leaking outside.
- Use wall-mounted directional antennas to broadcast signal inward only.
- Mount WAPs high up to reduce the risk of tampering.
- Use tools to measure signal strength and find the best spots.
- Make sure high-use areas have enough coverage.
- Stay clear of interference from things like microwaves or other electronics.

WAP placement requires coordination with:

- **Technology team** for optimal coverage and performance.
- **Cybersecurity team** to reduce risks like signal leakage outside the building that could be - exploited.
- **Physical security** team to prevent unauthorized physical access or tampering with access points.



## ESS Configuration

An Extended Service Set (ESS) configuration extends wireless coverage by interconnecting multiple wireless access points (WAPs) to provide seamless connectivity across a larger area. Proper configuration ensures efficient network performance and robust security.

- **SSID Management**
  - Use a consistent SSID for all access points to enable seamless roaming.
  - Hide SSID broadcast to enhance security.
  
- **Channel Assignment**
  - Configure non-overlapping channels to minimize interference.
  - Utilize automatic channel selection features if available.
  
- **Security Settings**
  - Apply strong encryption methods (WPA3) across all access points.
  - Implement consistent security policies and access controls.
  
- **Load Balancing**
  - Distribute client connections evenly across access points to prevent overload.
  - Adjust power settings to manage coverage and client distribution.
  
- **Roaming Optimization**
  - Enable fast roaming protocols (802.11r) to improve client handoff between access points.
  - Configure access points to support seamless transition without connection drops.
  
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**
  - Regularly monitor network performance and signal strength.
  - Schedule periodic maintenance and firmware updates for all access points.

## Interference Considerations

When deploying multiple wireless access points in an ESS configuration, interference must be carefully managed. Interference can degrade signal quality and reduce network efficiency, and there are only a limited number of channels that most wireless access points can use.

- **Co-Channel Interference**

    - Multiple WAPs in the same area, operate on the same channel or frequency bands
    - Reduces overall network throughput as devices contend for the same channel.
    - Signals between WAPs collide, requiring the data to be re-transmitted.
    - Re-transmission of data slows down the network since additional traffic is added.
    - Mitigate by using proper channel planning and spacing out access points.

- **Adjacent Channel Interference**

    - Happens when access points operate on overlapping channels.
    - Causes signal overlap and interference, reducing network performance.
    - Avoid by selecting non-overlapping channels (e.g., 1, 6, 11 in the 2.4 GHz band).

## Site Survey

Conducting a site survey is important for optimizing the placement and configuration of wireless access points. It helps identify potential interference sources, assess signal strength, and ensure comprehensive coverage.

- Evaluate physical environment and identify obstacles.
- Measure existing signal strength and coverage areas.
- Identify sources of potential interference (e.g., microwaves, neighboring networks).
- Determine optimal locations for access points.

## Heat Map

A heat map visually represents the signal strength and coverage of wireless access points within a specific area. It is an invaluable tool for planning and optimizing wireless networks.

- Displays areas of strong and weak signal coverage.
- Highlights potential dead zones and areas needing improvement.
- Assists in identifying interference sources and their impact on coverage.
- Aids in optimal placement of access points for maximum coverage and performance.
- Provides a clear visual aid for stakeholders to understand network performance.

## Wi-Fi Discovery and Mapping 

Wi-Fi discovery and mapping involve techniques used to locate and document the presence and details of Wi-Fi networks. These methods can range from ground-based activities to aerial searches, each serving different purposes and scales of mapping.

- **War-chalking**

  - Involves marking public spaces to indicate the presence of Wi-Fi networks.
  - Symbols are often drawn with chalk on sidewalks, walls, or other visible surfaces.
  - The symbols convey information about the network's availability and security.
  - It helps others locate and understand the types of Wi-Fi networks in the area.

- **War-driving**

  - Searching for Wi-Fi networks by driving around in a vehicle equipped with a Wi-Fi-enabled device. 
  - The goal is to map out the locations and details of wireless networks.
  - A laptop, smartphone, or other device with Wi-Fi capability is used.
  - The device typically runs software that detects and logs Wi-Fi network details.
  - The gathered data can include SSIDs, signal strength, and security types.

- **War-flying**

  - Similar to war-driving but involves searching for Wi-Fi networks from an aircraft.
  - This method can cover larger areas more quickly than ground-based methods.
  - Networks are detected and logged as the aircraft flies over different areas, e.g. drones.
  - Allows for  mapping of Wi-Fi networks over extensive regions, e.g. remote, less accessible areas.
