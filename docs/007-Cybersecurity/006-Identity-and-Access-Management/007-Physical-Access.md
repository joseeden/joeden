## Physical access controls

Physical access controls are tangible security measures designed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or specific areas within a facility.

**Examples of Physical Access Controls**

- Security Guards
- Fences
- Motion Detectors
- Locked Doors/Gates
- Sealed Windows
- Lights
- Cable Protection
- Laptop Locks
- Badges
- Swipe Cards
- Guard Dogs
- Cameras
- Mantraps/Turnstiles
- Alarms

**Priority in Deployment**

- Biggest concern is the safety and security of personnel, followed by the protection of other physical assets belonging to the company.
- Various physical access control mechanisms can be deployed to manage and monitor access to a facility, ranging from deterrents to detection systems. Each area requires distinct physical access controls, monitoring, and preventive measures.

### Physical Security

- **Badge Systems and Gate Entry**
   - Examples are Turnstiles, mantraps, remotely/system-controlled door locks.
   - Access control devices are assigned and activated 
   - Include biometric characteristics in high-security environments.
   - System compares individual's badge against a verified database.
   - For card types: Bar code, magnetic stripe, proximity, smart, hybrid.

- **Environmental Design**
   - Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) focuses on passive design elements.
   - Directing flow, signaling authorized spaces, providing visibility to reduce the likelihood of criminal activities.

- **Biometrics**
   - User's registered biometric code stored in the system or on a smart card.
   - User presents biometric data for comparison with the stored code.
   - High accuracy, potential expense, user discomfort, privacy concerns, device sanitization challenges.
   
- **Biometric Types**
    - **Physiological** 
      - Fingerprint, iris scan, retinal scan, palm scan, venous scan.
    - **Behavioral** 
      - Voiceprints, signature dynamics, keystroke dynamics.

### Securing Facilities

- **Fences**
  - Structure that encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts.
  - Crafted with materials such as wood, metal, wiremesh, concrete, etc.
  - Visual deterrent, shows where property starts and ends.
  - Delays intruders, providing security personnel longer time to react.

- **Bollards**

  - A bollard is a short post embedded into a street or sidewalk. 
  - These posts are common in city and building designs
  - Boundary markings or protective barriers, redirecting vehicular traffic

- **Mantrap** 

  - A Mantrap is a small room with an entry door on one wall and an exit door on the opposite wall. One door of a mantrap cannot be unlocked and opened until the opposite door has been closed and locked. Mantraps are often used in physical security to separate non-secure areas from secure areas and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Access Control Vestibules**

  - Double-door system with two electroniccally-controlled doors that ensure only one door is open at any given time.
  - Like a mantrap, a security vestibule consists of a small space between two sets of doors, but it may be larger and more open.
  - It can serve multiple purposes, such as controlling foot traffic, reducing drafts, or creating a barrier for noise.
  - Prevents the following:
    - **Piggybacking** 
      - Involves two people, with and without access, entering a secure area.
      - Intentionally allowing the second person to enter. 

    - **Tailgating**
      - Unauthorized person closely follows someone with access without their knowledge and consent.

- **Door Locks**      
  - Padlocks 
  - Simple pin and tumbler locks
  - Numeric locks 
  - Wireless locks 
  - Biometric locks
  - Cipher locks

### Surveillance System 

Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given area.

- **Security Guards**
  - Security guards discourage individuals from attempting unauthorized access.
  - Acts as a visible deterrent against impersonation or tailgating.

- **Video/Cameras (CCTV)**
  - Deter criminal activity.
  - Serve as forensic tools.
  - Centrally monitored for swift response.
  - Features:
    - Motion detection 
    - Night vision
    - Facial recognition 
    - Remote access
    - Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ)

- **Lighting**
  - Proper lighting is crucial for an effective surveillance system.
  - Well-lit areas can also deter criminals
  - Can be integrated with motion sensors  - lights on when motion is detected.

- **Motion Sensors**
  - Detect and respond to external changes in the environment.
  - Categories:
    - Infrared Sensors 
    - Pressure sensors
    - Microwave sensors
    - Ultrasonic sensors

- **Integrated Sensors**
  - Deployed in doors, gates, and turnstiles.
  - Strain-sensitive cables and vibration sensors.
  - Detect and respond to potential breaches.


### Logging

This includes physical logs, such as sign-in sheets or electronic access system logs. It emphasizes the importance of logs in supporting business needs, compliance, and forensic investigations.

- **Log Protection**
  - Essential for legal and business reasons.
  - Safeguarded against manipulation and unauthorized disclosure.

- **Review and Retention**
  - Regular log review integral to the security program.
  - Established guidelines for log retention aligned with policy.

- **Log Anomalies**
  - Identification of unusual occurrences crucial.
  - Key step in security issue detection during audits or routine monitoring.

- **Business and Legal Variances**
  - Varying requirements for log retention.
  - Compliance influenced by legal guidelines and industry standards.


### Alarm Systems

Alarm systems aim to promptly notify relevant authorities in case of unexpected events.

- **Basic Functionality**
  - Commonly on doors/windows, designed to signal unexpected openings.
  - Simplest form alerts appropriate personnel when unauthorized access occurs.

- **Access Control**
  - Authorized access (e.g., code/badge) does not trigger an alarm.
  - Unauthorized access (e.g., forced entry) activates the alarm.

- **Fire Alarm Systems**
  - Activated by heat or smoke sensors.
  - Audible warnings safeguard lives and notify local response teams.

- **Emergency Response**
  - Panic buttons serve as a quick alert mechanism.
  - When activated, alerts police or security personnel for immediate response.

### Visitor Management Policy 

A visitor management policy is a vital component of physical access controls, as it helps organizations track and manage visitor access.

  - Ensures legitimacy and monitors movements for facility and asset security.
  - Describe purpose of visits and explain visit approval authority.
  - Describe requirements for unescorted access and who may escort visitors.
  - Visits should be logged, e.g. signing on record book or electroniccally
  - Vistors must wear the visitor badge at all times while inside.

## Choosing an Access Control System

The following are some considerations:

- Performance is primary factor.
- Includes control effectiveness, reliability, scalability, and compatibility.
- Critical factor is the system's ability to perform its intended function effectively and reliably.

Example: 

- Choosing a biometric system for higher security performance despite complexity.
- Simplicity and efficiency are secondary considerations.
- Aesthetic appeal is irrelevant to the primary function of access control.

Primary consideration when choosing physical access controls:

- While building, equipment, and network security matter, **personnel security is the top priority.**
- Examples of Controls: Locks, security cameras, and security personnel.
- Designed to safeguard both people and assets.
- Security cameras and personnel to deter and respond to threats like theft, violence, and unauthorized access.
  
**Reference:** ISC2 Study Guide, Chapter 3, Module 2.

## Site Assessment 

- **Factors Considered**
  - Sensitivity of protected information, 
  - cost of scanners, and 
  - impact on employees and operations.

- **Primary Consideration**
  - The result of the site assessment.
  - This is a critical factor when implementing access controls for a physical site

- **Example**
  - Biometric scanners installed based on sensitivity; needed for server rooms, executive offices, but not break rooms or supply closets.

- **Reference**: ISC2 Study Guide, Chapter 3, Module 1.

## Physical Attacks

- **Attacking with Brute Force**

  - Forcible entry like disabling locks
  - Tampering with security devices 
  - Confronting or attacking the security personnel
  - Ramming a barrier with a vehicle

- **Bypassing surveillance systems**

  - Visual obstructions 
  - Blinding sensors and Cameras
  - Interfering with acoustics
  - Electronic interference 
  - Physical environment attack, e.g. causing fire

- **Access badge cloning**

  - Refers to copying data from a badge to a blank device
  - Cloned badge can then be used to trick the system
  - How attackers clone badges:
    - Scanning 
    - Data exfiltration 
    - Writing to a new card 
    - Using a cloned access badge
