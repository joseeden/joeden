## Overview

Reconnaissance, or **information gathering**, is the first step in a penetration test. The goal is to collect as much data as possible about the target to find potential vulnerabilities.

- Identifies weak points and attack surfaces
- Helps plan more effective and targeted attacks
- Can include stealthy methods to avoid detection
- Ensures the test covers all possible areas


## Types of Reconnaissance

### Active Reconnaissance

This method involves directly interacting with the target to gather data. It's more detailed but also more likely to be detected.

- Network scanning to find active hosts and services
- Sending packets or queries to get system responses
- Using tools like `ping`, `nmap`, and `traceroute`


### Passive Reconnaissance

This approach avoids touching the target system. It gathers info through public sources, making it harder to detect but may return less detail.

- Checking websites, social media, and public records
- Analyzing press releases or job postings
- Monitoring traffic externally or using third-party sources


## Environment Classifications 

These classifications describe how much information the tester has before the test. Each simulates different levels of attacker knowledge.


### Known Environment

The tester has full knowledge of the target system, including its architecture, configurations, and security measures. 

- Allows for comprehensive and detailed testing
- Resembles an insider threat scenario
- Useful for internal audits and deep testing

### Partially Known Environment

The tester has limited knowledge of the system.

- Combines insider and outsider perspectives
- Simulates a partner, contractor, or semi-informed attacker
- Helps uncover gaps between known and unknown areas
- Some information is available but full details are not disclosed


### Unknown Environment

The tester knows nothing about the system beforehand.

- Simulates an external attacker with no access
- Requires extensive reconnaissance and discovery
- Offers a real-world view of outside attack risks


## Methods and Techniques

### Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

OSINT uses publicly available sources to gather information without touching the targetâ€™s systems.

- Search engines to find public data about the target
- Forums, blogs, and social media to uncover discussions and leaks
- Extracting hidden data (metadata) from documents and images

### Network Scanning

Network scanning helps identify active systems, open ports, and running services in the target network.

- Tools like **Nmap*- to find open ports and services
- Scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Mapping the network to see how devices are connected


### Footprinting

Footprinting maps out the network architecture, infrastructure components, and their relationships. This technique builds a detailed picture of the target's network layout and systems.

- Collecting data on devices, operating systems, and software versions
- Identifying external and internal network boundaries

### Social Engineering

This technique targets people rather than systems to trick them into giving up sensitive information.

- Tricking users into revealing credentials or other sensitive data
- **Phishing*- emails that look legitimate to steal login info
- **Pretexting*- by pretending to be someone trusted
- **Baiting*- with fake updates, free software, or USB drives
