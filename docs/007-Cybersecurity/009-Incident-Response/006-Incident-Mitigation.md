## Incident Mitigation Mode

Once the full incident response team assembles, they move beyond isolation and quarantine, entering full mitigation mode to control damage and loss.

- Focus on controlling damage and limiting loss to the organization.
- Incident containment activities will vary based on the incident's severity.

## Containment Strategies

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) outlines six criteria to assess potential containment strategies.

- **Damage and Theft Potential**  
    - Assess risk to sensitive data and resources.
    - Ensure containment limits unauthorized access.

- **Evidence Preservation**  
    - Focus is on preserving evidences.
    - Protect evidence for legal and forensic needs.
    - Avoid strategies that delete or corrupt key data.

- **Service Availability**  
    - Responders should evaluate service availability requirements.
    - Balance containment with maintaining essential services.
    - Consider segmenting affected systems to limit impact.

- **Time and Resources**  
    - Estimate time and staff needed for containment.
    - Ensure resources are available for quick action.

- **Effectiveness**  
    - Determine if the strategy fully or partially contains the threat.
    - Consider partial fixes if full containment is not immediate.

- **Duration**  
    - Evaluate how long the containment will be effective.
    - Plan for transitioning from temporary to permanent fixes.

Organizations should use these criteria to balance security and business needs during incident response.

- Strategies should align with business needs while maintaining security objectives.
- Incident responders should use judgment and consult management and stakeholders when possible.

## Attacker Response to Containment

Containment actions may alert the attacker, causing them to accelerate harmful activities.

- Attacker may speed up activities to cause more damage.
- Attacker might destroy evidence or perform other actions to hinder the response.

## Post-Containment

After containment, the organization should reach a semi-stable state where:

- The incident appears to be over with no immediate threat.
- Business operations function, potentially with temporary workarounds.
- The organization is ready to proceed to recovery and reconstitution.
