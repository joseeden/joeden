## Overview 

A **security baseline** is a set of minimum security controls and practices to maintain a consistent level of protection across an organization.

- Platform-specific, based on industry or government standards.
- Establishes basic security settings and configurations.
- Helps measure compliance and identify risks.
- Regularly updated to address new threats.

Example: Rules for securing organizational devices

- Assign responsibility to a specific individual or officer.
- Protect devices against unauthorized access.
- Ensure devices do not compromise other systems or data.
- Keep devices under control of trained administrators.
- All device activities comply with organizational data security policies.


## Baseline Components

Key elements of a security baseline:

- **Establish Minimum Security Requirements**

  - Define essential security controls.
  - Address common threats and vulnerabilities.

- **Standardize Security Practices**

  - Create consistent procedures for security tasks.
  - Ensure uniformity across systems and departments.

- **Regularly Update Baselines**

  - Review and update controls to address new threats.
  - Include lessons learned from incidents and audits.

- **Implement Access Controls**

  - Enforce access policies for sensitive information.
  - Restrict access to authorized personnel only.

- **Monitor Compliance**

  - Regularly check systems for adherence to baseline.
  - Use audits and monitoring to detect deviations.

- **Provide Training and Awareness**

  - Educate staff on baseline policies and responsibilities.
  - Foster a culture of security awareness.

- **Document and Communicate**

  - Clearly document the baseline for reference.
  - Share updates and requirements with all stakeholders.


## Security Control Baseline

Security control baselines define minimum security controls for information systems.

**NIST SP 800-53B** defines baselines based on system impact levels:

1. **Low-Impact System**

    - Basic controls for systems with minimal risk.
    - Protects confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

2. **Moderate-Impact System**

    - Stronger controls for systems with moderate risk.
    - Addresses a wider range of threats.

3. **High-Impact System**

    - Maximum controls for critical systems.
    - Includes extensive monitoring and safeguards.

4. **Privacy Control Baseline**

    - Focuses on protecting personal and sensitive data.
    - Aligns with privacy regulations and standards.


## System Configuration Managers

Configuration managers automate the deployment of secure configurations across devices, reducing errors and ensuring compliance.

- **Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)**
  - Centralized management of Windows devices.
  - Automated deployment of software updates and security policies.
  
- **Ansible**
  - Open-source tool for automating IT tasks.
  - Manages configuration of multiple systems simultaneously.

- **Puppet**
  - Automation tool for managing server configurations.
  - Ensures consistent and compliant configurations across servers.

- **Chef**
  - Automation platform for infrastructure configuration.
  - Uses code to define and manage configurations.

- **SaltStack**
  - Event-driven IT automation and configuration management.
  - Provides remote execution capabilities for quick policy updates.

- **Intune**
  - Cloud-based service for managing mobile devices and applications.
  - Enforces security policies and compliance settings on enrolled devices.


## Monitoring 

Once the baseline requirements are set and deployed across the enterprise, administrators should continue to monitor systems for compliance with the baseline.

- Users may change settings accidentally.
- Administrators may misconfigure policies.
- Attackers may attempt to bypass controls.

**Solution:** automated monitoring checks thousands of systems against the baseline, quickly identifying deviations for investigation.


## Industry Standards on Security

Security standards provide guidelines for consistent protection across industries. They are created by:

- Vendors
- Government agencies
- Independent organizations

Organizations can customize standards to meet specific needs while maintaining best practices.

Company XYZ will adopt the Center for Intenet Security Benchmark Standard for Windows Server 2012 R2 systems, dated April 28, 2016, with the following modifications:

**Change Requirement**:
    
**Section 1.1.2**: Use a 180-day password expiration instead of the standard's default 60-day expiration period.

**Section 1.2.2**: Lock out accounts after five incorrect logins instead of the standard's default 10-attempt threshold
