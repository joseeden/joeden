## Incident Response Models 

Incident response models provide structured approaches to handling and mitigating security incidents. Different models cater to various organizational needs, resources, and levels of expertise, ensuring that incidents are managed efficiently and effectively.

### Leveraged Incident Response Model

The leveraged incident response model involves outsourcing incident response capabilities to external experts and outside resources that may not be available internally. This approach ensures a comprehensive response to security incidents by leveraging third-party services or partnerships.

- Provides access to specialized tools and technologies maintained by external experts.
- Offers 24/7 incident response capabilities, enhancing readiness to handle emergencies.
- Enables organizations to benefit from industry-specific expertise that may be lacking internally.
- Reduces the burden on internal resources, allowing teams to focus on core business activities.

### Dedicated Incident Response Model

The dedicated incident response model is structured around establishing an internal team exclusively dedicated to managing and mitigating security incidents. This model ensures a swift and targeted response to security events, leveraging the familiarity and expertise of in-house resources.

- Establishes an in-house incident response team.
- Team members are dedicated solely to handling and mitigating incidents.
- Enables a rapid and focused response to security events.

### Hybrid Incident Response Model

The hybrid incident response model integrates both internal and external resources to effectively manage security incidents. By combining the strengths of in-house teams with the specialized capabilities of external partners, this model provides adaptable and scalable incident response capabilities.

- Utilizes both in-house teams and external support as needed.
- Offers flexibility and scalability in managing incidents effectively.

## Incident Response Teams

Establishing a Security Operations Center (SOC) necessitates the creation of an efficient incident response team. 

### Roles

- **First Responder Role** 

  - IT professionals often serve as the first responders.
  - They distinguish security incidents from routine IT problems.

- **Training Requirement** 

  - Specific trainingis essential to identify and  report security incidents.

- **Team Composition** 

  - An incident response team is typically comprised by cross-functional members representing various areas impacted by security incidents.

    - Leader/Management
    - Subject Matter Experts 
    - IT Support Staff 
    - Legal Counsel
    - Public Relations
    - Human Resource


### Responsibilities

General responsibilities: 

- **Training Requirement** 
  - Team members should undergo training on the orrganization's incident response plan.

- **Investigation and Assessment**
  - Assist in investigating the incident.
  - Assess the extent of the damage.

- **Evidence Collection and Reporting**
  - Collect evidence related to the incident.
  - Report the incident to relevant stakeholders.
- **Recovery Procedures:**
  - Initiate and participate in recovery procedures.

- **Remediation and Analysis**
  - Participate in remediation efforts.
  - Contribute to the lessons learned stage.
  - Assist with root cause analysis.

Dedicated Incident Response Teams (CIRTs/CSIRTs):

- **Primary Responsibilities:**
  - Determine the extent and scope of damage.
  - Assess the compromise of confidential information.
  - Implement recovery procedures.
  - Supervise additional security measures for prevention.


## Incident Response Exercises

Incident response drills and exercises are conducted to simulate real-world scenarios and test the organization's incident response capabilities. 

- Vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security posture can be identified and addressed.
- The organization can then improve its overall resilience against potential cyber threats.

### Training

Training ensures staff grasp processes and priorities for incident response.

- Integrate past lessons-learned into training.
- Tailored training for diverse employee needs.
- As an example, a first responder and a manager may have different training requirements.

Varying Training per roles:

- **First responders** 

  - Procedures 
  - Machine re-image 
  - Removing malware 
  - Change configuration settings 

- **Managers** 

  - Risk vs. Rewards 
  - Decision-making and Communication
  - Law enforcement and media

- **End Users**

  - Report suspected incident occuring
  - Remedial Training

### Testing

This is the practical exercise of incident response procedures.

- Training teaches what to do, testing make sure you know how to do it.
- Simulating an incident, can cost time and money
