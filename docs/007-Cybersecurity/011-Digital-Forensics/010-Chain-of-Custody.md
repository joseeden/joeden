## Chain of Evidence

Also known as the **Chain of Evidence**, the Chain of Custody is the documented process that tracks the handling, transfer, and storage of evidence from its collection to its final presentation in court or other legal settings. 

- Records each step of evidence collection, transfer, and storage.
- Logs when evidence changes hands, including who, when, and why.
- Securely store evidence to prevent unauthorized access or loss.
- Evidence should be labeled and stored in a sealed container.

## Provenance of Artifacts 

Provenance of artifacts refers specifically to the detailed history or origin of the digital evidence (artifacts). 

- Where the evidence came from 
- How it was collected
- Who handled it throughout the process. 
- About the "story" and traceability of the evidence

The provenance of artifacts is a specific section within the chain of custody forms/documents and maintained through the **evidence logs**, ensuring the chain of custody is intact and evidence integrity is preserved.

## Evidence Logs 

A clear chain of custody helps ensure evidence is admissible in court by demonstrating its integrity. Evidence logs should accompany each piece of evidence and should contain the following events:

- Initial collection of evidence
- Transfer of evidence
- Storage of evidence
- Opening and resealing of evidence container

Each time an entry is recorded in the evidence log, it should contain:

- Investigator name
- Current date and time
- Nature of the action
- Purpose of the action


## Breach of Chain of Custody

A breach in the Chain of Custody can undermine the integrity of evidence, raising concerns about its authenticity and reliability in legal cases.

- Defense teams may challenge the admissibility of evidence.
- Breaks in custody make it harder to verify the evidence's origin.
- Evidence may be altered or contaminated, weakening its credibility.
- Reconstructing custody gaps can slow down the legal process.
