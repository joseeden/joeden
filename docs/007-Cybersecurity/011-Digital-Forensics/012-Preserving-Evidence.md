## Overview

Cybersecurity professionals are often required to participate in electronic discovery (e-discovery) efforts when legal actions involve their organizations. These efforts focus on preserving, collecting, and producing evidence relevant to disputes. 

## Legal Hold

Also known as a **litigation hold**, legal hold is a formal notice requiring an organization to preserve all relevant information and data for potential or ongoing litigation, investigations, or legal proceedings. 

- **Prevent evidence loss or tampering.**
- Initiated when litigation is anticipated or pending, or when an investigation is underway.
- Notify relevant individuals to ensure preservation compliance.
- Document all communications and actions related to the legal hold.
- Ensures continued preservation throughout the legal process.

Most litigation holds remain in the preservation and collection phases without progressing to production. A few cases reach a point where evidence must be presented in court, with many disputes being settled or not proceeding further.


## Lifting the Hold 

**Lifting the Hold** refers to the process of removing a hold. This action typically occurs when the legal proceedings or investigation have concluded or reached a resolution. It allows previously restricted activities or information to resume normal operation or accessibility. 

## Electronic Discovery

Electronic Discovery, or eDiscovery, is the process of identifying, collecting, reviewing, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) for legal or investigative purposes.

- Involves emails, documents, databases, social media, etc.
- Utilizes eDiscovery tools to handle large data sets
- Follows legal guidelines for evidence management
- Requires coordination between IT, legal, and compliance teams
- Ensures proper documentation of evidence for court use

The key steps in eDiscovery are preservation, collection, and production.

### Preservation

The goal of preservation is to maintain the integrity of the electronic information, which is essential for building a strong case or responding to legal requests. During this step:

- Issue a litigation hold to notify relevant parties to preserve records
- Halt automated data deletion processes, such as log purges
- Ensure all related information is maintained intact for legal use

Preservation could include: 

- Making backup copies 
- Isolating critical systems 
- Implementing access controls

### Collection

Collection involves gathering the preserved data for legal review.

- Retrieve data from servers, personal devices, emails, and cloud systems
- Cybersecurity teams support in retrieving and organizing data
- Use eDiscovery tools to manage the collected information

### Production

Production is when relevant data is shared with the opposing party in legal disputes.

- Attorneys review and select relevant data not protected by legal privileges
- Create an electronic file with selected records to share with the other side
- Most cases do not reach this phase due to settlements or other resolutions
