- **Psychological Manipulation**
  - Techniques such as deception, persuasion, or intimidation are used to exploit human behavior.
  - Exploits cognitive biases or emotional triggers to influence decision-making.

  - May involve adopting a false identity or impersonating authority figures.
  - **Brand Impersonation** - Pretending to represent a legitimate brand or company.

- **Dumpster Diving**
  - Searching through trash to find discarded documents containing valuable information.
  - Can yield sensitive data such as financial records, passwords, or corporate documents.

- **Shoulder Surfing**
  - Covertly observing or eavesdropping on individuals as they enter sensitive information.
  - Perpetrators may use hidden cameras or binoculars to capture information from a distance.

- **Tailgating**
  - Following authorized personnel into secure areas without proper authentication.
  - Exploits social norms or politeness to gain unauthorized access to restricted areas.

## Social Engineering Tactics

- **Authority**
  - People tend to comply with requests from perceived authority figures or institutions.
  - Attackers exploit this trigger by posing as authority figures to gain trust and compliance.

- **Intimidation**

  - Attackers use threats or coercion to pressure victims into compliance.
  - Fear of negative consequences, such as job loss or legal action.
  - This tactic aims to bypass logical thinking by creating anxiety and stress.

- **Urgency**
  - Urgent situations prompt hasty actions without proper evaluation.
  - Attackers create pressure to force quick decisions or information disclosure.


- **Consensus/Social Proof**
  - People follow others' actions in uncertain situations.
  - "Wisdom of the crowd", "Herd mentality"
  - Attackers use fake testimonials, reviews, or endorsements to gain trust and credibility.

- **Scarcity**
  - People value items or opportunities that are perceived as scarce or in high demand.
  - Attackers create artificial scarcity or deadlines to encourage immediate action or compliance.

- **Likeability/Familiarity**
  - People are more likely to comply with requests from those they like or trust.
  - Attackers use charm or flattery to build rapport and manipulate targets.

- **Fear**
  - Fear of loss, harm, or negative consequences can override logical decision-making.
  - Achieved through legal action threat, financial loss, or personal harm to coerce targets.
  - This factor prompts individuals to act impulsively.

## Influence Campaigns

Influence campaigns aim to sway perceptions and attitudes on a wide scale, often leveraging media, social networks, and other communication channels to disseminate their messages.

- **Misinformation**
