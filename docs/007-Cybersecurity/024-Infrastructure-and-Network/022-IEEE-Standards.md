## Overview

IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) sets standards for networking, security, and communications. These standards help organizations build secure, reliable, and compatible systems.

- Guides network protocols and data security  
- Ensures devices and systems work together  
- Helps follow best practices and compliance  
- Supports secure design and operations  


## IEEE 802

IEEE 802 defines networking rules for LANs and WANs. It includes security guidelines and ensures devices communicate reliably.

## IEEE 802.1X  

Controls access to networks by verifying devices before they connect.

- Port-based network access control  
- Requires devices to authenticate before using the network  
- Supports dynamic encryption keys for secure communication
- Works with wired and wireless networks  
- Uses authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS and TACACS+
- Common in corporate environments to enhance security

## IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)  

Defines wired LAN connections and ensures stable communication.

- Standard for wired Ethernet networks  
- Provides link-layer security and reliability  
- Supports error detection and recovery  

This keeps wired networks consistent and secure.

## IEEE 802.11 (Wireless LAN)  

Covers wireless networks and ensures Wi-Fi works securely and efficiently.

- Defines Wi-Fi protocols and security  
- Includes multiple variants for speed, range, and security  

## IEEE 802.11a  

Early high-speed Wi-Fi for 5 GHz networks.

- Operates at 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps  
- Less interference than 2.4 GHz  
- Shorter range than 2.4 GHz networks  
- Supports multiple channels for performance  

## IEEE 802.11b  

Original 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi standard.

- Operates at 2.4 GHz, up to 11 Mbps  
- Widely compatible with older devices  
- Longer range but more interference  
- Suitable for basic web and email usage  

## IEEE 802.11g  

Faster Wi-Fi on 2.4 GHz, backward compatible with 802.11b.

- Up to 54 Mbps on 2.4 GHz  
- Works with older 802.11b devices  
- Better performance than 802.11b  
- Supports multimedia streaming  

## IEEE 802.11e  

Enhances Wi-Fi and provides QoS support of multimedia traffic.

- Prioritizes voice and video traffic  
- Reduces latency for critical applications  
- Supports traffic classification  
- Improves performance in busy networks  

## IEEE 802.11i (WPA2)

WPA2 was designed to improve upon security methods implemented with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). 

- Adds strong security to Wi-Fi networks
- Provides WPA2-level encryption  
- Enforces authentication and integrity checks  
- Protects against common attacks  
- Required for enterprise Wi-Fi security  

## IEEE 802.11ac  

High-speed Wi-Fi for modern networks.

- Operates at 5 GHz, high throughput  
- Supports MU-MIMO for multiple device access  
- Improved range and speed compared to 802.11a/g  
- Handles streaming, gaming, and large data transfers
