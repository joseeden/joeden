## Overview 

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that creates a secure and tamper-resistant way to record and verify transactions.

:::info 

**Zero-knowledge proofs** are heavily used in blockchain technologies (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs). It lets one party prove they know certain information without revealing it.

## Applications in Cybersecurity

**Secure Data Storage**: 

- Blockchain can be used to store sensitive information securely.
- This leverages immutability to prevent tampering.

**Identity Verification**: 

- Blockchain-based identity solutions use cryptographic techniques.
- This verify users without relying on centralized authorities.

**Supply Chain Security**: 

- Blockchain can enhance supply chain security.
- It can provide an immutable record of product provenance and traceability.

## Features

### Immutability 

Once data is added to a blockchain, it cannot be changed without agreement from the network.

- Makes records tamper-resistant and ensures a reliable audit trail
- Increases trust in data integrity and historical accuracy
- Helps detect unauthorized changes or fraud attempts


### Consensus Mechanisms

Blockchain relies on consensus algorithms to agree on the validity of transactions, ensuring trustworthiness in a decentralized environment.

Common consensus mechanisms include:

- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Stake (PoS), which help 


### Cryptographic Security

Blockchain relies on cryptography to ensure secure and trustworthy transactions.

- Uses digital signatures and public-key cryptography for identity verification
- Each block links to the previous one using a cryptographic hash
- Creates a tamper-evident and traceable chain of records



## Decentralization

Blockchain runs without a central authority by distributing control across many nodes.

- Reduces single points of failure
- Each node operates independently
- Redundant design improves resilience against failures and attacks


## Public Ledger

A public ledger records all blockchain transactions in a way that’s secure, anonymous, and transparent.

- Allows anyone to track and verify transactions
- Does not rely on a central authority
- Immutable and accessible by all participants



## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing programs on a blockchain that run automatically when conditions are met.

- Enforce contract terms without intermediaries
- Transparent and tamper-proof once deployed
- Ensure predictable outcomes based on code logic

### Common Use Cases

Smart contracts automate processes across many industries.

- **Financial Transactions** – Automated payments, insurance claims, or loans
- **Supply Chain Management** – Tracking goods and automating logistics
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** – Run financial services without banks

### Challenges of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts offer benefits but also pose certain risks.

- Bugs or logic errors can be exploited
- Difficult to update once deployed
- Legal recognition varies by jurisdiction


## Permissioned Blockchain

A permissioned blockchain restricts access to the network and its operations to approved participants.

- Only trusted users can access or validate data
- Rules and roles are managed by designated entities
- Faster and more scalable due to controlled participation

Unlike public blockchains, where anyone can join, permissioned blockchains require users to be granted specific roles or permissions.

### Applications of Permissioned Blockchain

Often used in business settings for privacy and control.

- **Enterprise Use** – Handles sensitive data securely within organizations
- **Consortia** – Collaboration between trusted groups with shared governance
- **Private Transactions** – Supports confidential business operations

### Challenges of Permissioned Blockchain

While secure, permissioned blockchains have trade-offs.

- **More Centralized Control** – Reduces decentralization, increasing reliance on few parties
- **Lower Transparency** – Not open to public auditing or participation
- **Limited Resilience** – Less robust against tampering compared to public networks

## Security Considerations

### Fifty-one Percent Attack

Occurs when an attacker controls the majority of a blockchain network’s power.

- Gains over 50% of mining or validation power
- Can alter transactions, double-spend, or block new ones


### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

Smart contracts are automated code on blockchains, but flaws in their design can be exploited.

- Bugs in code may lead to loss of funds
- Poor input validation can trigger unintended actions
- Exploits can’t be reversed once executed on-chain


### Privacy Risks

Blockchain data is often public, which can expose user activity.

- Transactions are traceable even without names
- Patterns can reveal identities or sensitive behavior
- Raises concerns in financial and healthcare use cases

### Key Management

Users must protect private keys to keep blockchain assets secure.

- Losing a private key means losing access to assets
- Stolen keys allow full control of the associated funds
- Secure storage and backups are critical
