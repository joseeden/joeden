## Physical Access Controls

Physical access controls are tangible measures that prevent, detect, or monitor direct contact with systems and secure areas.

- Protect people first, then assets  
- Range from deterrents to detection and response tools  
- Each area needs tailored controls and monitoring


### Badge Systems and Gate Entry

Badge systems control who can enter a space.

- Use turnstiles, mantraps, or controlled doors  
- Compare badges to a verified access database  
- Biometrics added for high-security zones

For card types: 

- Barcode
- Magnetic stripe
- Proximity
- Smart
- Hybrid  


### Environmental Design

Design spaces to reduce crime by shaping visibility and flow.

- Apply Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)  
- Direct traffic and highlight authorized areas  
- Improve natural surveillance and reduce hiding spots

### Biometrics

Biometrics use physical or behavioral traits to identify people.

- Store a template for comparison or on a smart card  
- High accuracy but can be costly and raise privacy concerns  

Types:

- **Physiological**: fingerprint, iris, retina, palm, vein  
- **Behavioral**: voice, signature dynamics, keystroke

### Iris Scans and Retina Scans 

An **iris scan** uses a camera to take a picture of the colored part of the eye from a distance, making it non-invasive and fast, and is widely used for security and identification.

- Iris patterns remain stable throughout a person's life
- This makes it a reliable biometric authentication method
- Has a very low false acceptance rate, making it a highly accurate
- Iris patterns can be recognized from a distance (nonintrusive)
- Disadvantage: Scanners can be fooled by high-quality images of a person's face.

A **retina scan** requires a close-up, invasive process that uses a beam of light to map the blood vessels on the back of the eye and is now primarily used for medical diagnostics

### Fences, Bollards, and Mantraps

- **Fences**

  - Encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts.
  - Visual deterrent, shows where property starts and ends.
  - Made with materials such as wood, metal, wiremesh, concrete, etc.
  - Delays intruders, provides security personnel longer time to react.

- **Bollards**

  - A bollard is a short post embedded into a street or sidewalk.
  - These posts are common in city and building designs.
  - Boundary markings or protective barriers.

- **Mantrap** 

  - Small room with an entry door and exit door.
  - One door stays locked until the other closes.
  - Separates secure and non-secure areas to prevent unauthorized access.

### Access Control Vestibules

Small controlled spaces to prevent unauthorized entry.

- System with two electronically-controlled doors
- Ensures only one door is open at any given time.
- Can control foot traffic and reduce drafts or noise

Like a mantrap, a security vestibule consists of a small space between two sets of doors but the space may be larger and more open. It can prevent the following:

- **Piggybacking** 
  - Two people, with and without access, entering a secure area.
  - Intentionally allowing the second person to enter. 

- **Tailgating**
  - Unauthorized person closely follows someone with access without their knowledge and consent.

### Door Locks

Common lock types used in facilities:

- **Padlocks** 

  - Portable locks for doors, gates, lockers, or storage.
  - Can be key-operated or combination-based
  - Made of brass, steel, or laminated metal.

- **Pin tumbler locks**

  - Most commonly used tumbler lock.
  - Require the key to have just the right grooves.
  - The key align spring-loaded pins to lock or unlock.

- **Wafer tumbler locks**

  - Also called *disc tumbler locks*.
  - Small, round locks usually seen on file cabinets.
  - Uses flat discs (wafers) instead of pins inside the locks.
  - Easy to bypass because it can be easily circumvented. 

- **Cipher locks**

  - Also known as *programmable locks*
  - keyless and use keypads to control access into an area.
  - Requires a specific combination and possibly a swipe card.
  - Cost more, but their combinations can be changed.
  - Specific combination sequence values can be locked out
  - Supports duress code which opens the door and initiate a remote alarm.

- **Combination locks**

  - Unlocks with a number sequence, not a key.
  - User spins the lock interface left and right by so many clicks
  - When the internal wheels must aligned, the door is opened.

- **Biometric locks**

  - Use fingerprints, iris, face, or hand geometry.
  - Harder to duplicate; can log entries.
  - Some combine biometrics with keypads or cards for extra security.


### Surveillance System 

Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given area.

- Security Guards act as visible deterrents  
- Cameras deter crime and provide forensic evidence  
- Lighting improves camera effectiveness and deters intruders  
- Motion sensors trigger alerts and can integrate with lighting

Categories of motion sensors:

- Infrared Sensors 
- Pressure sensors
- Microwave sensors
- Ultrasonic sensors

### Integrated Sensors

Sensors embedded in doors, gates, and structures.

- Use strain-sensitive cables, vibration, pressure, or motion sensors  
- Detect forced entry or tampering quickly

### Logging

Record keeping for access and security events.

- Protect logs against tampering and unauthorized access  
- Review logs regularly and keep retention policies documented  
- Watch for log anomalies as an early warning sign
- Includes physical logs, e.g. sign-in sheets, electronic access logs.


### Alarm Systems

Alarm systems aim to promptly notify relevant authorities in case of unexpected events.

- **Basic Functionality**
  - Commonly on doors/windows, designed to signal unexpected openings.
  - Simplest form alerts appropriate personnel when unauthorized access occurs.

- **Access Control**
  - Authorized access (e.g., code/badge) does not trigger an alarm.
  - Unauthorized access (e.g., forced entry) activates the alarm.

- **Fire Alarm Systems**
  - Activated by heat or smoke sensors.
  - Audible warnings safeguard lives and notify local response teams.

- **Emergency Response**
  - Panic buttons serve as a quick alert mechanism.
  - When activated, alerts police or security personnel for immediate response.

### Visitor Management Policy 

A visitor management policy helps organizations track and manage visitor access.

- Log visitor details and purpose of visit  
- Visits should be logged, e.g. signing on record book or electroniccally
- Define who may escort visitors and who gets unescorted access  
- Issue visible visitor badges and require them to be worn

## Detectiom Systems 

### Perimeter Intrusion Detection System

**Perimeter Intrusion Detection and Assessment System (PIDAS)** detects anyone trying to cut, climb, or tamper with a fence.

- Sensors are installed on the fence and at the base
- Detects vibration or movement on the fence.
- Passive cable sensors trigger alarms
- Sends alerts to security or monitoring system


### Electromechanical Detection System

Electromechanical systems reliably detect physical tampering using simple electrical and mechanical components.

- Contact switches detect forced openings on doors and gates
- Strain gauges sense pulling or impact on panels
- Control units map events to alarms
- Can route alerts to monitoring systems


### Passive Infrared (PIR) System

PIR sensors detects human presence by sensing body heat and movement.

- Monitors infrared energy in a defined area
- Detects warm bodies moving through
- Can be used indoors or outdoors
- Integrates with alarms or lighting


### Acoustical Detection System

Acoustical systems detects sounds of tampering like cutting, climbing, or breaking.

- Uses microphones or acoustic sensors near perimeters
- Filters background noise to identify suspicious sounds
- Can trigger cameras or alarms


### Photometric System

Photometric detection uses light or image analysis to detect changes.

- Cameras or light sensors monitor for unusual activity
- Detect shadows, openings, or motion
- Supports image analysis for alerts
- Can verify alerts from other sensors


## Choosing an Access Control System

The following are key factors when selecting controls.

- Performance is primary factor.
- Prioritize safety and reliability next  
- Consider scalability, compatibility
- Balance cost and complexity with security needs

Example: 

- Choosing a biometric system for higher security performance despite complexity.
- Simplicity and efficiency are secondary considerations.
- Aesthetic appeal is irrelevant to the primary function of access control.


## Site Assessment 

Decide controls based on site sensitivity and impact.

- Assess sensitivity of data and critical areas  
- Choose higher security (e.g., biometrics) for server rooms and exec offices  
- Avoid over-securing low-risk areas like supply closets

Example: 

Biometric scanners installed based on sensitivity. They are needed for server rooms, executive offices, but not break rooms or supply closets.

## Physical Attacks

- **Attacking with Brute Force**

  - Forcible entry like disabling locks
  - Tampering with security devices 
  - Confronting or attacking the security personnel
  - Ramming a barrier with a vehicle

- **Bypassing surveillance systems**

  - Visual obstructions 
  - Blinding sensors and Cameras
  - Interfering with acoustics
  - Electronic interference 
  - Physical environment attack, e.g. causing fire

- **Access badge cloning**

  - Refers to copying data from a badge to a blank device
  - Cloned badge can then be used to trick the system
  - How attackers clone badges:
    - Scanning 
    - Data exfiltration 
    - Writing to a new card 
    - Using a cloned access badge
