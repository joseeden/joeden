## Overview

Software development methodologies define how software is planned, developed, and delivered. Each methodology has trade-offs in flexibility, speed, and risk management.

## Waterfall Methodology

A traditional sequential approach to software development.  

- Classic linear approach to development.  
- Best for projects with stable requirements
- Changes are difficult once a phase is done.

Waterfall follows sequential phases: 

> Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment.  


## Extreme Programming (XP)

Agile approach emphasizing quality and adaptability.  

- Agile approach focused on quality and responsiveness.  
- Uses pair programming, test-driven development, and frequent releases.  
- Encourages continuous feedback and collaboration.

## Incremental Methodology

Develops software in small functional increments.  

- Builds software in small portions called increments.  
- Each increment adds functionality and can be deployed early.  
- Allows early feedback and gradual improvement.

## Spiral Methodology

Iterative approach that focuses on risk management.  

- Iterative approach emphasizing risk management.  
- Each cycle includes planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.  
- Suitable for high-risk or complex projects.

## Rapid Prototyping

Creates prototypes quickly to clarify requirements.  

- Quickly develops a prototype to clarify requirements.  
- Refined iteratively based on user feedback.  
- Reduces risk of building the wrong system.

### Variants of Prototyping

Different ways to apply prototyping for feedback and testing.  

- **Evolutionary Prototyping**: Grows gradually into the final system.  
- **Operational Prototyping**: Tested in the real environment for performance and usability.

## Joint Application Development (JAD)

Collaborative workshops to gather requirements and build consensus.  

- Collaborative workshops with developers and users.  
- Speeds up requirements gathering and consensus.  
- Improves communication and reduces misunderstandings.

## Cleanroom Methodology

Focuses on preventing defects through rigorous processes.  

- Focuses on preventing defects rather than fixing them.  
- Uses formal specifications, statistical quality control, and rigorous testing.  
- Emphasizes correctness by construction.

## Reuse Methodology

Leverages existing components to speed up development.  

- Builds software using existing components.  
- Encourages modular design and component libraries.  
- Saves time and reduces errors.

## Exploratory Methodology

Flexible, trial-and-error approach for uncertain requirements.  

- Informal, trial-and-error approach.  
- Useful when requirements are unclear or research-oriented.  
- Emphasizes learning and adaptation.

## Rapid Application Development (RAD)

Fast-paced iterative approach using prototypes.  

- Fast development with prototypes and iterative releases.  
- Prioritizes speed and user feedback over detailed documentation.  
- Best for small to medium projects with clear requirements.

## Agile Methodology

Iterative approach emphasizing collaboration and adaptability.  

- Iterative and incremental approach emphasizing flexibility.  
- Promotes adaptive planning, continuous delivery, and stakeholder feedback.  
- Frameworks include Scrum and Kanban.

Agile methodology does not use prototypes to represent the full product but breaks the product down into individual features that are continuously being delivered.

:::info

A notable element of many Agile methodologies is their focus on user stories. A user story is a sentence that describes what a user wants to do and why.

## Kanban

Visual workflow management system to optimize tasks.  

- Visual system to manage workflow.  
- Tracks tasks on boards to optimize flow and reduce bottlenecks.  
- Limits work in progress for better efficiency.

## Scrum

Agile framework with defined roles and iterative sprints.
