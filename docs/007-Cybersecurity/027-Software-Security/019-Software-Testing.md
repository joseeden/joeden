## Overview 

Throughout the software development process, frequent testing ensures that the final product meets both functional and business requirements.

- Essential for proper functionality
- Key activities: validation and verification

## Model Validation vs. Verification  

These two important testing activities answer different questions during development.

- **Validation**: Are we building the right software? (Meets business requirements)
- **Verification**: Are we building the software right? (Proper functioning)

## Stress and Load Testing  

Before release, code must be tested under real-world conditions to ensure it can handle expected loads.

- Simulates real-world activity using automated scripts
- Verifies system capacity and maximum load capabilities
- Tests continue until system failure to determine limits

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)  

This final phase ensures that the software is intuitive and usable under real-world circumstances.

- Performed in a testing environment
- End users simulate real-world transactions
- Focus on usability and ease of use (often referred to as "beta testing")

## Regression Testing  

After launch, modifications to the software must be tested to ensure they donâ€™t cause unintended issues.

- Verifies no negative impacts from code changes
- Compares system behavior before and after updates
- Focuses on maintaining functionality while adding new features


## Misuse Case Testing

Misuse case testing focuses on identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities by simulating how a system might be misused. It helps in detecting weaknesses that attackers could exploit.

- Simulates malicious or unintended uses to find vulnerabilities.
- Complements traditional testing by focusing on misuse scenarios.
- Helps improve system resilience against abuse.

The most critical step in misuse case testing is defining the test cases. Testers need to think like attackers and figure out all the ways that someone might try to undermine the security of a system. 

- Ask developers: How could someone break into the system?
- Developers who worked on the sofwtare bring an in-depth understanding.
- Others who are not involved in the project brings fresh eyes and perspectives.

Misuse case examples: 

- Unexpected input (in size or format)
- Missing input
- Injection attacks
- Unavailable funds

## Interface Testing

Interface Testing ensures that different software components or systems interact correctly and reliably. This type of testing focuses on validating the data exchanges, communication protocols, and integration points between systems.

- Ensure that data sent between systems is accurate and complete.
- Test the adherence to defined protocols and formats for communication.
- Confirm that error messages are properly handled and communicated.

### Types of Interfaces

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**

  - Allows different software systems to communicate programmatically
  - Defines methods and data formats for interactions
  - Enables integration and functionality across various applications

- **User Interface (UI)**

  - Involves interactions between users and software through visual elements
  - Includes components like buttons, menus, and forms
  - Focuses on usability, accessibility, and user experience

- **Physical Interfaces**

  - Connects hardware devices or hardware to software
  - Examples include ports, connectors, and cables
  - Facilitates data transfer and device interaction
