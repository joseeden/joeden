## Security Risks in Software Development  

Software development can introduce significant security risks for organizations, making it essential for cybersecurity professionals to safeguard development environments.

- Protects against external threats
- Reduces risk to production systems and sensitive data

Effective risk management begins with identifying and mitigating risks associated with software.

- Perform risk analysis to identify potential threats
- Implement mitigation strategies to reduce likelihood and impact of risks

## Integration of Security in SDLC  

Security must be embedded throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), regardless of the approach (waterfall, spiral, agile).

- Integrate security in design, development, testing, and deployment
- Avoid "bolt-on security" practices to maintain effectiveness

## Understanding Security Risks  

Developers should be aware of various security vulnerabilities to avoid them effectively. Key risks include:

- [SQL injection](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/051-List-of-Attacks/006-Injection-Attacks.md)
- [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/051-List-of-Attacks/099-Other-Attacks.md)
- [Cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF)](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/051-List-of-Attacks/099-Other-Attacks.md)
- [Buffer overflows](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/051-List-of-Attacks/015-Overflow-Attacks.md)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies  

To enhance security, developers should implement controls to mitigate potential risks during coding. Some examples of risk mitigation:

- [Input validation](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/027-Software-Security/010-Application-Security.md#input-validation) on user input
- Encrypt sensitive data in databases
- Enforce the [principle of least privilege](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/026-Identity-and-Access-Management/005-IAM-Concepts.md#principle-of-least-privilege) for user accounts
- Conduct thorough code testing

## Using Sandboxing for Safety  

Sandboxing provides a controlled environment for development and testing, minimizing risks to the organization.

- Allows modification and testing without accessing production resources
- Works in conjunction with code repositories for version control
