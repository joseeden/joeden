## Internal Assessments

Internal assessments help an organization find risks and weaknesses in its systems.

- Help spot gaps in compliance and prepare for audits
- Usually done before launching new systems or major changes
- Conducted as self-assessments to check adherence to standards

Internal assessments combine tools and reviews to spot vulnerabilities. This ensures potential risks are understood before changes are made.

### Assessment Process 

This process ensures that organizations know their weak points and can plan how to reduce risks.

1. Identify potential threats using threat modeling
2. Use automated tools and manual checks to find vulnerabilities
3. Evaluate risks to see impact and cost of fixing them
4. Recommend mitigation strategies based on findings

## External Audits and Assessments

### External Audits 

External audits are evaluations done by outside parties to check security controls and overall system safety.

- Offer an unbiased view of security posture

- Identify gaps in policies and controls for regulatory compliance
- Example: Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS

### External Assessments

External assessments are deeper analyses to find vulnerabilities and risks.

- Combine automated scans and manual testing
- Include risk, vulnerability, and threat assessments


### Regulatory Compliance    

Organizations aim to meet laws and industry rules.

- Use unified compliance controls across the organization
- Follow industry standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR
- Apply frameworks like NIST Cybersecurity Framework for guidance


### Independent Third-Party Audit 

Third-party audits validate security measures and build trust with clients and regulators.

- Provide an impartial view of security posture
- Find weaknesses missed in internal checks
- Align with regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS
