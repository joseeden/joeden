## Overview

Vulnerability scans identify security weaknesses in systems and networks, helping organizations prioritize and mitigate potential risks.

- Uncover weak points that attackers might exploit.
- Compare systems against known vulnerabilities.
- Help maintain security by routine checks.



## Scanners 

There are three primary categories of scanners used to assess security:

- **Port Scanners**

   - Identify open ports on a network or system.
   - Help detect services that might be vulnerable to attack.

- **Vulnerability Scanners**

   - Identify security flaws in systems and networks.
   - Compare systems against known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

- **Application Scanners**

   - Scan web applications for security weaknesses.
   - Detect vulnerabilities like [SQL injection](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/051-List-of-Attacks/006-Injection-Attacks.md#sql-injections), [cross-site scripting (XSS)](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/051-List-of-Attacks/099-Other-Attacks.md), and insecure configurations.


## Types of scans

### Vulnerability Scan

Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in systems or networks by checking against known security flaws.

- **Non-Intrusive Scanning**
   - Gathers information without actively exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - Minimizes the risk of disruption to systems.
   - Safer for production environments.

- **Intrusive Scanning**
   - Actively tests for vulnerabilities by simulating an attack.
   - Can identify more issues but might disrupt services.
   - Best for testing in non-production environments.

### Configuration Scan

Ensures systems are securely configured to meet security standards and prevent misconfigurations that could create vulnerabilities.

- Checks the settings and configurations of systems and applications.
- Identify misconfigurations that could lead to security issues.
- Ensure compliance with security policies and best practices.

### Code Scan

Analyzes source code to detect security flaws before deployment.

- Detect coding errors and potential security weaknesses before deployment.
- Use SAST tools such as Fortify or Sonarqube to examine the source code.
- Integrated into the SDLC to ensure secure coding practices.


## Credentialed and Uncredentialed Scans

**Credentialed scans**, also called **Privileged scans**, have access to the system with provided credentials.

- Can inspect inside the operating system
- Including installed software and patch levels
- Gathers detailed configuration data with read-only access.

**Uncredentialed scans** work externally without login access, so they cannot verify patch status inside the system.

- Might miss vulnerabilities related to installed software updates
- Can also miss hidden vulnerabilities

Credentialed scans reveal internal patch and configuration issues like **missing third-party software patche**s that uncredentialed scans usually miss.

## Phases of Scanning

Vulnerability scanning typically involves the following phases:

1. Prepare assets and define the scan scope
2. Perform the scan to identify vulnerabilities
3. Remediate issues found
4. Document all findings and actions

Vulnerability scanning can be **cyclical**. You may rescan or reconfigure assets as needed, but eventually you must remediate and document those actions.

## Scan Reports 

Scan reports categorize findings to differentiate between real and false alerts, ensuring effective remediation.

- **False Negative**: A real vulnerability is missed.
- **False Positive**: A non-threatening issue is flagged.
- **True Positive**: A real vulnerability is accurately identified.
- **True Negative**: Non-malicious activities are recognized as safe.
