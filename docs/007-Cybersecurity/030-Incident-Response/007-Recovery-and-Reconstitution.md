## Overview

The recovery and reconstitution phase aims to restore the organization to its normal operations after an incident while ensuring that vulnerabilities are fixed to prevent future attacks.

- Remove any effects of the incident and return to normal operating status.
- Ensure all systems are protected against future attacks.

## Rebuilding Compromised Systems

Reconstruct compromised systems to their pre-incident state.

- Reinstall software and reconfigure settings.
- Restore files and data from backups.

## Malware Removal

Ensure all malicious software is removed.

- Run antivirus and anti-malware tools.
- Perform manual checks to verify system integrity.

## Disabling Breached Accounts

Secure compromised accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

- Lock affected user accounts.
- Reset passwords and apply stronger authentication.

## Data Restoration

Recover any lost or corrupted data.

- Use backup files to restore missing data.
- Verify the integrity of recovered files.

## Vulnerability Remediation

Address the vulnerabilities that led to the incident.

- Apply security patches.
- Update firewall rules and other access controls.

## Strengthening Access Control

Improve access to critical systems to prevent future breaches.

- Implement multi-factor authentication.
- Limit access to sensitive systems.

## Intrusion Prevention Systems

Set up systems to detect and prevent future attacks.

- Deploy intrusion prevention software.
- Regularly monitor network traffic for anomalies.

## Phased Approach

Take a gradual approach to long-term security improvements.

- Start with critical fixes for immediate security.
- Implement long-term solutions over time.
