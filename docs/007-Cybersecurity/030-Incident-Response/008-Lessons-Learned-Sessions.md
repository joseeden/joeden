## Overview

After an incident response, it’s crucial to conduct a lessons learned session to reflect on the team’s performance and improve future responses.

## Purpose 

This session aims to provide insights into the incident and enhance the organization's incident response capabilities.

- Reflect on individual and team roles.
- Identify areas for process and technology improvement.

## Conducting the Session

Gather participants to discuss the incident under the guidance of a neutral facilitator.

- Facilitate discussions with an unbiased leader.
- Conduct the session promptly to ensure fresh memories.
- The trained facilitator shouldn't have a role during the incident mitigation.
- This ensures that the facilitator doesn't have any preconceived notions about the response.
- The facilitator should be a neutral party that guides the conversation.

## Key Questions to Explore

Use NIST's framework to guide the discussion and collect valuable feedback.

- What happened and when?
- How effective were staff and management?
- Were procedures followed, and were they adequate?
- What actions might have hindered recovery?
- What would be done differently in future incidents?
- How can information sharing be improved?
- What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents?
- What indicators should be monitored for future detection?
- What additional resources are needed?

## Documenting Insights

Summarize the findings in an incident report for future reference.

- Collaborate with the team leader to document lessons learned.
- Include actionable suggestions for improvement. 

By addressing these points, organizations can significantly enhance their readiness for future incidents.
