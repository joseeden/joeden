## Overview

Cybersecurity experts must understand the types of evidence collected and how they may be used in legal proceedings. There are three main types of evidences:

- Real evidence
- Documentary evidence
- Testimonial evidence

## Real Evidence

Real evidence consists of tangible objects that can be presented in court.

- Physical items relevant to the case (e.g., computer equipment)
- Can be examined by all parties involved.
- Real evidence may consist of actual computer equipment.
- Example: An attorney showing a knife to the jury

## Documentary Evidence

Documentary evidence includes information presented in written or digital form.

- Helps demonstrate facts to the court. 
- Can be traditional documents or digital files (e.g., contracts, logs)
- May include digital evidence such as computer logs.

There are some legal rules that apply to the use of documentary evidence:

- **Authentication Rule**

  - Authentication must be verified by testimony (e.g., confirming signatures)
  - Someone must testify as to the legitimacy of the document.

- **Best Evidence Rule**

  - Original documents are superior to copies
  - Document copies may only be admitted to evidence when the original document is no longer available.

- **Parol Evidence Rule**

  -  Only written agreements are valid; verbal changes aren't accepted
  -  Any modifications require another written agreement.

## Testimonial Evidence

Testimonial evidence involves statements made by witnesses in court. The information may be provided by a witness, which can be direct or an expert. 

Testimonial Evidence may come in two forms:

  - **Direct Evidence** 
    - Based on personal observations (e.g., incident investigations)
    
  - **Expert Opinion** 
    - Professionals interpreting evidence (e.g., logs indicating intrusions)
    - Cybersecurity expert may look at logs and offer an expert opinion

When giving testimonial evidence, witnesses must avoid violations of the **hearsay rule**. This means that they may not testify about what someone else told them outside of court.


## Conclusion

Understanding these evidence types and their applications is crucial for cybersecurity experts involved in investigations.
