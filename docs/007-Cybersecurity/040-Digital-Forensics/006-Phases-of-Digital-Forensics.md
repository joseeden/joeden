## Identification 

Recognizing and determining relevant data or digital evidence.

- Identify the devices and data sources.
- Determine what is considered potential evidence.
- Define the scope and boundaries of the investigation.

## Collection

Gathering and acquiring digital evidence while preserving its integrity.

- Use forensically sound methods to collect data.
- Document each step in the collection process.
- Follow proper acquisition procedure.
- Maintain a clear [chain of custody.](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/040-Digital-Forensics/010-Chain-of-Custody.md)

## Analysis 

Examining collected data to uncover relevant information, patterns, or evidence.

- Examine the data for hidden, deleted, or altered information.
- Use specialized tools to analyze different types of digital evidence.
- Draw connections and correlations among different data points.

## Reporting

The final phase where findings from the analysis are documented and presented.

- Prepare a detailed and coherent report of findings.
- Ensure the report is accessible to non-technical audiences.
- Include necessary information for legal proceedings, such as evidence handling and conclusions.

## After Action Review (AAR)

An After Action Review (AAR) is a structured process for analyzing incidents or exercises to improve future performance. 

- Evaluate response effectiveness.
- Identify lessons learned.
- Foster continuous improvement.

### Key Components

- **Participation**: Involve all relevant stakeholders for diverse insights.
- **Documentation**: Collect data, timelines, decisions, and actions.
- **Analysis**: Assess successes and failures in processes and outcomes.

### Steps in Conducting an AAR

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Schedule shortly after the incident.
   - Gather reports, logs, and communications.

2. **Conducting the Review**: 
   - Facilitate open discussions.
   - Use guiding questions to evaluate intentions vs. outcomes.

3. **Documenting Findings**: 
   - Summarize key findings and recommendations.
   - Highlight successful strategies and areas needing improvement.

4. **Follow-Up**: 
   - Share the report with stakeholders.
   - Monitor implementation of action items.
