## Security+ 701 - Study Plan Overview

This guide includes study tips, how to use flashcards, other study tools, and two study plans (30-day and 60-day). It's designed to help you tailor a study routine that fits your learning style.

## General Study Tips

- Study methods are personal, so find what works best for you.
- Most people can focus for 20-30 minutes at a time. Switch tasks or take a break after this period.
  - Mix activities like watching videos, reviewing notes, and using study tools.
  - Adjust your study sessions based on how long you can stay focused.
- If a study strategy isn’t working after a few days, try a different approach.
- Give yourself small rewards for sticking to your plan, like 30 minutes of gaming or a favorite snack.
- Strike a balance between following your plan and making adjustments as needed.
- Don’t dwell on setbacks. Learn from them and adjust your study routine if necessary.

## Using Videos Effectively
- While watching, take notes, highlight key terms, and mark areas for more research.
- After watching, review notes, make flashcards, and go over the material from the previous day.

## Using Practice Exams
- When taking a practice exam, do a "brain dump" at the start to help organize your thoughts.
- After finishing, review incorrect answers, update your flashcards, and track your progress by noting which objectives you understood.

## Flashcards
- Writing flashcards helps with memory. Keep them consistent, such as definitions on one side and terms on the other.
- Use different colors for various topics, and include diagrams for visual reinforcement.
- Flashcard apps like Quizlet and Anki offer interactive ways to study and reinforce concepts.
- Creating your own flashcards is more reliable than using pre-made ones, which may contain errors.

## Additional Study Methods
- Turn exam objectives into questions to identify areas that need more focus.
- Use ChatGPT to check your understanding by answering questions before reviewing its responses.
