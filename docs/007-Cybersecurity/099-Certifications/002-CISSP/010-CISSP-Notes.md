Earning CPE:

    - Training 
    - Webinar

    - Group A credits relate directly to the cyber security profession. 
    - Generally, activities in the areas covered by the specific domains of the respective credential.
    - No maximum annual CPE  - you can accumulate as much CPE as you want.

    - Group B credits are earned for completion of general professional development activities which enhance your overall professional skills, education, knowledge, or competency outside of the domains associated with the respective certifications. 
    - These generally include professional development programs, such as management courses. 
    - While these do not apply directly to the domains, (ISC)² recognizes these skills are vital in the growth of all professionals and their credentials.
