## Azure Blob Storage 

Azure Blob storage is an object storage solution designed for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, including text and binary data. 

- Commonly used to host images, documents for web browsing, stream video or audio, store log files, backups, archive data, and data for analysis by on-prem or Azure-hosted processes.
- Objects in Blob storage can be accessed using HTTP or HTTPS.
- Accessible through Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Azure storage client libraries (Java, PHP, .NET, etc.).

Blob data stands for **Binary Large Object** data. Blob data and can represent a wide variety of types of data you normally store on your computer including images, videos, and documents.

### Key Resources

![](/img/docs/azure-blob-storage-key-resources.png)

1. **Storage Account**
   - Creates a unique namespace in Azure for accessing data.
   - Forms the base address for objects in the storage account.
   - Example URL: `http://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net` for a storage account named MyStorage.

2. **Containers**
   - Used to organize blobs within a storage account, akin to directories in a file system.
   - Unlimited containers within a storage account, each capable of storing an unlimited number of blobs.

3. **Blob Types**
   - **Block Blobs**
     - Can store up to about 190.7 TiB of text and binary data.
     - Consists of manageable blocks of data, hence the name.
   - **Append Blobs**
     - Optimized for append operations.
     - Suitable for logging data from virtual machines.
   - **Page Blobs**
     - Used for storing random access files up to 8 TiB.
     - Ideal for storing VHD files, serving as disks for Azure virtual machines.

      </p>

**Resource Relationship**
The storage account, containers, and blobs have a hierarchical relationship, forming a structured organization for your data.


<small>[Back to the top](#azure-storage)</small>

### Access Tiers 

- **Hot:** 

   - Intended for frequently accessed data.

- **Cool:** 

   - For infrequently-accessed data.
   - Optimized for data still needing immediate retrieval.
   - Lower storage cost but higher cost for reads and writes.
   - Data must be in cool tier for at least 30 days.

- **Archive:** 

   - Cost-effective for rarely accessed data 
   - Retrieval times of up to 15 hours.
   - 5x cheaper than cool tier for storage but much more expensive for reads.
   - Data must be in archive tier for at least 180 days.

Blob Storage allows setting a default access tier for the entire storage account and supports individual blob tier configurations. 

**Azure Data Lake Storage** Gen2 provides hierarchical storage on top of Blob Storage for specialized use cases.

### From the UI  

In the example below, we can see the important details in the **Overview** section of the Storage account. 

|![](/img/docs/azure-storage-blob-from-the-ui.png)|
|-|

- **Disk State** 
   - Indicates that the storage location is Available. 
   - In the event of an outage in Azure, you may see a different value here. 
   
- **Location** 
   - Determines the locations of primary and secondary storage location.
   - This storage account has no secondary storage location, but you can create storage accounts with primary and secondary storage locations. 

- **Performance** 
   
   - **Premium Storage** 
      - Use this when you need guaranteed latency 
      - Higher storage costs because they use solid-state drives (SSDs) 
   
   - S**tandard storage** 
      - Uses magnetic spinning hard disk drives (HDDs).

- **Replication** 
   - Sets the durability and availability of the storage. 
   - The following options are available:

      - **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** 
      
         - The cheapest option and stores the data in a single data center. 
         - If that data center goes offline you will not be able to access the data.

      - **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)** 
      
         - Stores data across three data centers in a region. 
         - It can tolerate individual data center outages but not regional outages.

      - **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)** 
      
         - Stores data across multiple data centers in two regions, a primary region and a secondary region. 
         - This option is more expensive but can tolerate entire regional outages. 
         
      - **Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)** 
      
         - Allows you to read from the secondary region compared to GRS which only allows you to access the secondary in the case of a Microsoft-initiated region failover to the secondary.

- **Account kind** 

   - **General-purpose** 
      
      - Allow storage of blobs, tables, files, and queues 
   
   - **Specialized kinds** 
   
      - Only allow one type such as only blob storage. 
      - There are different pricing models for each account kind so a specialized kind may reduce your costs. 
      - **StorageV2** is the recommended default.

   - Create a new rule named "LifecycleForReports."
   - Apply the rule to all blobs, specifically "Block blobs."
   - Define conditions to move blobs across tiers, example:
      - Move to Cool tier after 30 days
      - Move to Archive tier after 12 months
      - Delete after 10 years

3. **Additional Customizations:**
   - Implement filters based on blob names using blob prefix.
   - Enable access tracking for last access time-based conditions.

#### Command Line Configuration

1. **JSON File Creation:**
   - Create a JSON file containing the configured rules in the portal.
   - The JSON structure includes rule actions and filters.

2. **Uploading to Cloud Shell:**
   - In Cloud Shell, upload the JSON file.
   - Utilize Azure CLI commands for management policy creation.

3. **Command Example:**
   - Use the command: 

      ```bash
      az storage account management-policy create --account-name YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME --policy YOUR_JSON_FILE_NAME --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME  
      ```

4. **Applying Policies:**
   - Execute the command to apply the lifecycle policy to the specified storage account.
   - Policies take up to 24 hours to go into effect.

1. **URL Format** 
    - Specific URL format required to access a queue, including the storage account name and queue name.
    - Example URL: `http://mystorageaccount.queue.core.windows.net/images-to-process`
2. **Storage Account:**
   - All access to Azure storage services, including queues, is through a storage account.
   - The storage account acts as the overarching container for Azure storage.

3. **Queue** 
    - A queue is essentially a set of messages.
    - When naming a queue, use all lowercase letters.

4. **Message**
    - Messages can be in any format. and can be up to 64 kB in size.
    - Messages play a crucial role in enabling communication between different components of a distributed application.

## Azure Managed Disks 

Azure virtual machines (VMs) use Azure disks as their attached disk storage. 

- Azure disks are built-on top of page blobs which are the type of blobs optimized for random access. 
- When you create Azure disks you can choose to manage the storage account yourself or to use managed disks where Azure manages the storage account for you. 
- Managed disks are the preferred option.

Azure Managed Disks provide a virtualized, scalable, and highly available storage solution for Azure VMs. 

- Virtualized block-level storage volumes used with Azure VMs and managed by Microsoft Azure.
- The encryption options (SSE and ADE) enhance data security, and the distinction between data, OS, and temporary disks allows for efficient and purpose-driven disk management within the Azure infrastructure.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-managed-disks-benefits.png)

### Benefits

## Redundancy Options 

Azure Storage provides six redundancy options, ranging from locally-redundant to read-access geo-zone-redundant storage. Each option offers different levels of redundancy and pricing. 

![](/img/docs/azure-redundancy-options-complete-diagram.png)

Note that not all of these options are available in every region or for every type of data.


### Locally-Redundant Storage (LRS)

- **Replication:** Across racks in the same data center.
- **Disaster Consideration:** Data could be lost in a data center disaster.
- **Recommendation:** Use only if data reconstruction is easily achievable.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-redundancy-lrs.png)

### Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)

- **Replication:** Across three zones within one region.
- **Disaster Consideration:** Ensures data availability even if an entire zone goes down.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-redundancy-zrs.png)

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)

- **Replication:** Across two regions.
- **Disaster Consideration:** Requires geo-failover in the event of a regional disaster to access data in the secondary region.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-redundancy-grs.png)

### Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)

- **Replication:** Same as GRS.
- **Additional Feature:** Allows reading data immediately from the secondary region in case of a disaster in the primary region.
- **Write Access:** Not available until Microsoft restores availability in the primary region.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-redundancy-grs.png)

### Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)

- **Replication:** Across three availability zones in the primary region.
- **Difference from GRS:** Combines zone-redundant storage and geo-redundant storage.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-geo-zone-gzrs.png)

### Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)

- **Replication:** Same as GZRS.
- **Additional Feature:** Allows immediate reading from the secondary region in case of a disaster in the primary region.
- **Write Access:** Not available until Microsoft restores availability in the primary region.

   ![](/img/docs/azure-redundancy-zrs.png)



## Redundancy Pricing 

Naturally, each of these redundancy options has a different price. 

- Locally-redundant storage being the cheapest and 
- Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage being the most expensive. 
- RA-GRS is actually more expensive than GZRS even though it’s less redundant because it provides instant access to your data in the secondary region. 

![](/img/docs/azure-cost-redundancy-options-complete.png)

<small>[Back to the top](#azure-storage)</small>



## Performance Levels

Aside from the redundancy level and the default access tier, there’s yet another option you need to set when you create a storage account: the performance level.

- **Standard (Default)**

   - **Account Type:** General-purpose v2 account.
   - **Recommendation:** Suitable for most cases.

- **Premium**

   - **Account Type:** Higher-performance option.
   - **Consideration:** More expensive and limits redundancy options.
   - **Usage:** Recommended only if significantly faster performance is necessary.


## Data Transfer into Azure Storage

- **Azure Portal**

   - **Use:** For uploading a small number of files from the desktop.
   - **Capability:** Allows file upload and download directly through the portal.

- **AzCopy (Command-Line Utility)**

   - **Use:** For faster upload/download, especially for a large number of files.
   - **Capability:** Supports file and folder copying, including cross-cloud transfers.

- **Azure Storage Explorer (Graphical User Interface)**

   - **Use:** For managing files, changing access tiers, and copying files using a graphical interface.
   - **Capability:** Provides file management features beyond simple copying.

- **Azure File Sync**

   - **Use:** Specialized use case for creating a local cache of Azure Files on Windows servers.
   - **Capability:** Enhances access speed to an Azure file share in an on-premises environment.

## Migration Tools


- **Azure Migrate**

   - **Use:** Comprehensive tool for discovering, assessing, and migrating on-premises servers, web apps, and databases to Azure.
   - **Process:** Discovers on-premises resources, assesses size and cost of equivalent Azure services, facilitates migration.

- **Azure Data Box**

   - **Use:** For sending a large amount of data during migration.
   - **Process:** Microsoft ships a Data Box storage device, data is copied to the device, shipped back to Microsoft, and data is transferred to the Azure storage account.
   - **Consideration:** Typically used for data transfers exceeding 40 terabytes due to time and expense involved.
