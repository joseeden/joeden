## Containers 

Containers provide a lightweight and efficient way to package and deploy applications.

- Containers are a preferred method for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- They encapsulate an application and its dependencies, excluding the operating system.

**Challenges in Containerized Deployments:**

- Single Container Limitation 

  - Running a single instance of a container is usually insufficient for production applications.

- Microservices Architecture

  - Modern applications adopt a microservices architecture, dividing applications into separate containers.

**Container Orchestrator**

- Manage multiple containers, ensuring scalability, high availability, and efficient deployment.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that addresses the challenges of managing multiple containers in production. 
- Open-source container orchestrator.
- Manages clusters of virtual machines running containers.
- Key components: Nodes, Pods, Control Plane.

**Kubernetes Features**

- **Scalability:**
  - Easily scale the number of containers to meet demand.

- **High Availability:**
  - Ensures applications are available and responsive, even in the face of failures.

- **Microservices Support:**
  - Supports the deployment of applications as microservices in separate containers.

**Kubernetes Components**

- **Nodes:**
  - Virtual machines in the cluster, each capable of running one or more pods.

- **Pods:**
  - Basic deployment unit, containing one or more containers.

- **Control Plane:**
  - Manages nodes and pods, ensuring desired state and handling orchestration.

   

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service or AKS is Microsoft's managed Kubernetes service in Azure.

- Simplifies Kubernetes cluster creation, configuration, and management.
- Easier installation and configuration compared to manual Kubernetes setup.
- Integration with Azure services for enhanced capabilities.
- Simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications.

You can create an AKS cluster using:

- Azure CLI
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure portal
- Template-driven deployment options, like Azure Resource Manager templates, Bicep, and Terraform.
