    <img 
    width=300 
    src="../../Images/azure-vpn-gw.png">
    </p>

**Virtual Network Gateway**

When a virtual network gateway is deployed, Azure provisions two or more specialized VMs under the covers. 

- These specialized VMs are not accessible
- They are deployed to a special subnet that you create. 
- This special subnet is called the **gateway subnet**. 
- The specialized VMs that get deployed contain routing tables and they run specific gateway services. 

You can deploy VPN gateways in Azure Availability Zones so they can benefit from the resiliency, scalability, and higher availability that Availability Zones provide.
<p align=center>
![](/img/docs/azure-virtual-network-gway.png)
</p>

Once youâ€™ve deployed a VPN gateway, you can:

- Create an IPsec/IKE VPN connection between the VPN gateway and another endpoint, which could be another VPN gateway (to form a VNet-to-VNet connection).
<br>

    <p align=center>
    ![](/img/docs/azure-vnetgw-ipsec-ike.png)
    </p>

<br>

- Create an IPsec/IKE VPN connection between the VPN gateway and an on-prem VPN device (to create a Site-to-Site connection). 

- You could also create a Point-to-Site VPN connection that allows you or your users to connect to the virtual network from a remote location.

### Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

Provides secure granular access to storage resources without compromising data security.

![](/img/docs/azure-sas-tokennns.png)

**Types**

- **User Delegation SAS:** 
    - Applies to Blob storage
    - Secured with Azure AD credentials
    - Microsoft recommends to use Azure AD credentials whenever possible to enhance security

- **Service SAS:** 
    - Secured with the storage account key
    - Used to delegate access to a specific service (Blob, Queue, Table, or Azure Files)

- **Account SAS:** 
    - Secured with the storage account key
    - Used to delegate access to one or more storage services

**How SAS works** 

- SAS is a signed URI with a special token and query parameters, including a signature.
- SAS URI is then presented to Azure Storage as part of a request
- Azure checks SAS parameters and signature for validity; declines unauthorized requests.

![](/img/docs/azure-sas-how-it-worksss.png)

  

### Storage Account Keys

When you create a storage account, Azure generates two 512-bit keys which you can use to authorize access to data that resides in your storage account via Shared Key authorization.

- Use Azure Key Vault to manage, rotate, and regenerate the keys
- Regularly rotate and regenerate keys
- Key rotations can be performed without interrupting the applications that use them
- Storage accoun access are essentially root passwords; protect them by not distributing, saving in plain text, or hard coding in apps.

  

### Azure Storage Analytics

Performs logging and provides metrics data for storage accounts.

- Ideal for tracing storage requests, analyzing usage trends, diagnosing storage account issues.
- Needs to be enabled for each service to monitor storage requests and analyze usage trends.
- 20TB limit for stored data, independent of the total storage account limit.

- Has Server-level and Database-level Firewall rules

<p align=center>
![](/img/docs/azure-sql-firewall-rules-server-level-database-level-fw-rules.png)
</p>

**Levels**

- **Server-level IP Firewall Rules:** 
   - Allow access to the entire Azure SQL server, covering all hosted databases.
   - Created for the entire server, regardless fo how many databases it holds
   - Master database holds these rules.
   - Max of 128 rules.

- **Database-level IP Firewall Rules:** 
   - Allow access to specific databases on the SQL Database server. 
   - Created for each database, including the master database
   - Max of 128 rules per database.

For more information: [SQL Database Firewall Rules Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure)

  

### Azure SQL Always Encrypted

Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) within client applications, ensuring separation of data owners and managers.

- Clients encrypt sensitive data before sending it to SQL Server, with decryption done transparently on query results.
- Ensures unauthorized users, inclduing database admins, can't access sensitive data.
- Driver needs to be installed on te computer, which then automatically encrypts/decrypts data
- Available in all editions of Azure SQL Database since SQL Server 2016.

For more information: [Always Encrypted Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine)

  

### Azure SQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

Encrypts Azure SQL Databases, Azure SQL Managed Instances, and Azure Synapse data at rest to protect against offline attacks.

- Real-time encryption/decryption of database, backups, and transaction log files without application changes
- Enabled by default for newly deployed Azure SQL databases
- However, it cannot be used to encrypt the logical master database because it needs objects that TDE needs to perform the encryption
- Manual enabling required for older databases

For more information: [Transparent Data Encryption Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql)

  

### Azure SQL Database Auditing

Azure SQL Database Auditing tracks database events, logging them to an audit log hosted in Azure storage, Log Analytics, or Event Hubs. It facilitates regulatory compliance, monitors database activity, identifies anomalies, and detects security violations.

**Configuration**

- **Database-Level Auditing:** 
   - Specific to a database
   - Can be defined in a default server policy for all databases

- **Server-Level Blob Auditing:** 
   - Audits all databases on the server
   - Auditing always applies regardless of any database-level settings
   
**Considerations** 
- When both Database Auditing and Server Blob Auditing is enabled, both audits will exist separately
- Avoid simultaneous enabling of both server blob auditing and database blob auditing, unless:
    - Each used a different storage account
    - Each database will have different retention period
- Recommended to enable server-level blob auditing only, unless there's a specific need for database-level auditing  

  

## Dynamic Data Masking in Azure SQL

Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) is a technology supported by Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics. 

- Limits exposure to sensitive data by dynamically masking it for users who lack the necessary permissions
- DDM operates as a policy-based security feature, concealing specific sensitive data returned from database queries 
- DDM hides sensitive data without altering the data stored in the database.

  

### Use Case

An example scenario for DDM involves a call center employee who needs to identify a caller by confirming the last four digits of their social security number. 

- The employee doesn't require access to the entire social security number 
- DDM allows the definition of masking rules to hide sensitive data in query result sets
- Enables employees to perform tasks without unnecessary data exposure

### Configuration

**Accessing Dynamic Data Masking**

- **For SQL Database:**
    - Use the Dynamic Data Masking blade under Security in the SQL Database configuration pane.

    <p align=center>
    ![](/img/docs/azure-sql-dynamic-data-masking.png)
    </p>

- **For SQL Managed Instance:** 
    - Configuration is performed using PowerShell or REST API.
    - Not available in the Portal.

**Settings to Configure**

- **Excluded Users:**
    - Specifies SQL users or Azure AD identities excluded from masking.
    - Users with administrator privileges are always excluded.
    
- **Masking Rules:**
    - Defines fields to be masked using schema name, table name, and column name.
    - Specifies the masking function for each rule.

- **Masking Functions:**
    - Determines how data is exposed under specific conditions.


  

### Masking Functions

| Function            | Description                                             |
