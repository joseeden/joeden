## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing involves accessing and utilizing computing resources and services over the internet, provided by third-party vendors. It offers scalability, flexibility, and reduced dependency on on-premise hardware.

- Servers 
- Storage 
- Databases 
- Networking
- Software Analytics 
- Intelligence


## Cloud Concepts 


TO learn more, check out **Cloud Foundations** section.

    - Compliance with regulatory requirements and standards.
  
- **Patch Availability**

    - Patch management processes to ensure timely application of updates.
    - Vulnerability scanning and assessment tools.
  
- **Inability to Patch**

    - Risk assessment and prioritization of unpatched vulnerabilities.
    - Compensating controls or mitigation strategies.
    - Regular security audits and assessments.
  
- **Power**

    - Redundant power sources such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or backup generators.
    - Monitoring and maintenance of power infrastructure.
    - Energy-efficient hardware and cooling systems.
  
- **Compute**

    - Performance benchmarks and optimization techniques.
    - Load balancing for efficient resource utilization.
    - Capacity planning based on workload requirements and growth projections.


## Managed Service Provider (MSP)

A company managing IT assets for another organization and is Commonly utilized by small- and medium-sized businesses for day-to-day IT operations.

- **Outsourcing Functions**
  - Used to outsource specific IT functions or manage entire operations.
  - Expertise provided in areas where the company lacks internal capabilities.

- **Services Provided by MSPs**
  - Network and security monitoring.
  - Patching services.
  - Cloud-based solutions, including Managed Detection and Response (MDR).

- **MDR Service Example**
  - Managed Detection and Response (MDR) involves active incident investigation and response.
  - Monitors security tools, such as firewalls, for event triaging.

- **Common MSP Implementations**
  - Augmenting in-house staff for projects.
  - Implementing products or services.
  - Providing payroll services.
  - Managing Help Desk service.
  - Responding to and managing security incidents.
  - Overseeing all in-house IT infrastructure.

## Service-Level Agreement (SLA)

It is an agreement between a cloud service provider and customer that defines the quality of cloud services, specific to cloud computing terms and roles.

- **Importance of SLA**
  - Functions as a rule book and legal contract.
  - Outlines minimum service levels, availability, security, controls, and more.

- **Purpose of SLA**
  - Documents specific parameters, service levels, and remedies for failures.
  - Addresses data ownership, return, and destruction details.

- **Key SLA Points**
  - Cloud system infrastructure and security standards.
  - Customer's right to audit legal and regulatory compliance.
  - Rights and costs associated with service use continuation/discontinuation.
  - Service availability and performance.
  - Data security, privacy, and location.
  - Disaster recovery processes and data access.
  - Data portability and problem identification/resolution.
  - Change management processes and dispute mediation.
  - Exit strategy considerations.

## Common Security Challenges 

- **Shared Physical Server Vulnerabilities**
    - Multiple users often share the same underlying physical servers in a cloud environment.
    - Isolation mechanims prevent unauthorized access between virtual machines.
    - Regular security assessments and audits of underlying hardware.
    - Implementation of hypervisor security measures to mitigate risks.

- **Inadequate Virtual Environment Security**
    - Segmentation of virtual networks and resources.
    - Intrusion detection and prevention systems within virtual environments.
    - Regular security updates and patches for virtualization software.

- **User Access Management**
    - Role-based access controls (RBAC) to limit privileges based on job roles.
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced user verification.
    - Regular reviews and audits of user permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Lack of Up-to-date Security Measures**
    - Continuous monitoring for security vulnerabilities and emerging threats.

- **Single Point of Failure**
    - Redundancy and failover mechanisms across multiple data centers or availability zones.
    - Load balancing to distribute traffic and mitigate the impact of failures.
    - Disaster recovery plans to maintain operations in the event of a failure.

- **Weak Authentication and Encryption**
    - Strong encryption protocols for data transmission and storage.
    - Secure key management practices to protect encryption keys.
    - Regular password policy enforcement and password rotation.
    - For more information, please see [Data Encryption.](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/002-Asset-Security/006-Data-Encryption.md)

- **Unclear Policies and Data Remnants**
    - Clear data retention policies outlining data lifecycle management.
    - Secure data deletion procedures to ensure data remnants are properly erased.
    - Compliance with regulatory requirements regarding data privacy and disposal.

## Cloud Security Controls 

- **Instance Awareness**
    - The idea is to be aware of how many VMs are being managed.
    - "**VM Sprawl**, overprovisioning VMs which can lead to unused or forgotten VMs.
    - More VMs means increased attack surface.

- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**
    - Enforces security policies when accessing cloud resources.
    - Usually a VM that runs on-prem, acts as a middle-man.
    - Can restrict VM types that can be deployed, limit storage account size, etc. 

- **Next-Generation Secure Web Gateway (SWG)**
    - Security appliance that has the CASB functionality, with additional capabilities.
    - Web content filtering, data loss prevention (DLP), firewall abilities.

- **CSP Secure Solutions**
    - Azure and AWS Network Security Groups
    - Azure Policies; controls cloud resource deployments and compliance.

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solutions**
