## Public Cloud 

A Public Cloud provides shared infrastructure resources like compute, storage, and databases, accessible over the internet. Users pay for what they use and can scale resources on demand.

- Users do not manage physical hardware.
- Users can choose data storage locations for performance.
- The cloud vendor handles maintenance and infrastructure management.

As a general rule, you can access your services on the Public Cloud from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection. 

## Private Cloud 

A Private Cloud is a dedicated infrastructure managed by the organization. It offers greater control and security but requires physical hardware and higher costs.

- Provides direct control over infrastructure and data.
- Requires significant capital expenditure for hardware and data center.
- Higher operational costs due to in-house maintenance.


## Hybrid Cloud 

A Hybrid Cloud combines Public and Private Clouds, linking them through a network. It provides flexibility for handling various workloads and disaster recovery.

- Integrates both cloud types to extend the internal network.
- Offers benefits of both models but requires managing both environments.
- Often used for temporary setups or as a transitional phase.
