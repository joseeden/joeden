## Overview

Cloud migration can follow different strategies depending on business goals, technical requirements, and constraints. Each approach has its own benefits and use cases.

- **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**

  - Move servers or applications from on-premise directly to the cloud.
  - Quick migration with minimal changes.
  - Scalable and pay-as-you-go.
  - Ideal for organizations starting migration or with tight deadlines.

- **Replatform (Modify Lift and Shift)**

  - Make small optimizations during migration.
  - Improves efficiency without full redesign.
  - Enhances performance for specific workloads.
  - Reduces long-term maintenance costs.

- **Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**

  - Switch to a different product or service
  - Often changing licensing or platform.
  - Moves away from incompatible software.
  - Can reduce licensing complexity.

- **Refactor (Rearchitect)**

  - Redesign the application to be cloud-native.
  - Improves availability and reliability.
  - Enables better scalability and flexibility.

- **Retain (Hybrid or Partial Migration)**

  - Keep some systems on-premise due to readiness or regulations.
  - Supports phased migration.
  - Ensures compliance with legal or corporate policies.

- **Retire (Turn Off Services)**

  - Identify and shut down unused or low-value services.
  - Reduces costs and operational complexity.
  - Focuses resources on key business areas.
