## Document Sources

The digital legal documents are sourced in two ways. 

- Customer grants Expertise Please the right to scan and digitize their paper based court documents. 
    - Highly automated process that only requires human intervention in scanning files. 
    - Digitized documents are stored in the Expertise Please service. - Original documents are archived by a legal processing agency on behalf of the customer.

- External third party companies send contracts as PDFs directly to Expertise Please customers. 
    - PDF files are uploaded via sFTP, and processed in batches during off peak hours. 
    - Third party companies can also log in to view contracts, and to check on the status of batch uploads. Most of the documents being stored are sensitive so there are stringent requirements. 

     
## Requirements

- **Security**

    - Documents can only be viewed by the end customer to whom they're addressed. 
    - Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest. 
    - Business must adhere to industry standards, e.g. ISO27001, ISO27018.

- **Durability**

    - Digital legal documents are retained for an unlimited period of time, or until a customer deletes a document, or closes the account.
    - Company have observed that less than 2% of the documents older than six months are viewed.
    - Service has to provide highly-durable storage of documents

- **Availability**

    - End consumers access the application at any time.
    - Current target availability SLA is 99.5% for web service
    - Goal is to increase it to 99.9%.
    - Third parties can deliver digital documents at any time, 24 hour processing in SLA exists. 

- **Performance**

    - Customer response time to render documents is less than two seconds. 
    - Current SLA is 9.5% of transactions to meet this target. 


## Current Architecture

Existing architecture is a three-tier web application comprising of:

- Apache web server
- JBOSS application server
- Oracle database

Networking:

- Connectivity is provided by co-location provider
- Peak capacity 500 megabits per second
- DNS hosted on DNS servers within the same data center 
- No CDN used 

Firewall:    

- Clustered firewall appliances
- IDS monitoring of traffic
- Manual implementation of firewall rules to block malicious traffic

LoadBalancer: 

- Front end for SSL upload 

Web servers:
