## Overview

GetItDone is an app used by residents to report public issues.

- Residents report potholes or broken streetlights
- The data is sent to city systems through AWS
- Use Boto3 and other AWS tools to analyze and visualize reports


## Pre-requisites

Required: 

- [Create an AWS Account](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/050-Project-Pre-requisites/001-AWS.md) 
- [Create the IAM Policy](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/050-Project-Pre-requisites/001-AWS.md#create-the-iam-policy) 
- [Create the IAM User](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/050-Project-Pre-requisites/001-AWS.md#iam-users)
- [Create the IAM Access Keys](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/050-Project-Pre-requisites/001-AWS.md#access-keys)

**Note on the IAM Policy**: The IAM policy attached to your IAM must have the following permissions:

- `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
- `AmazonRekognitionFullAccess`
- `TranslateFullAccess`
- `ComprehendFullAccess`


## 1. Create Multiple AWS Clients

Create a client for S3 and SNS.

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-east-1',
                  aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID,
                  aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)

sns = boto3.client('sns', region_name='us-east-1',
                   aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID,
                   aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)

buckets = s3.list_buckets()
topics = sns.list_topics()

print(buckets)
print(topics)
```

## 2. Create S3 Buckets

Create S3 buckets to organize your data for different parts of your project.

- `gid-staging`
- `gid-processed`
- `gid-test`

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-east-1',
                  aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID,
                  aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)

response_staging = s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-staging')
response_processed = s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-processed')
response_test = s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-test')

print(response_staging)
```

Next, list all buckets in your AWS account to confirm your setup.

```python
response = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])
```

Sample output:

```
gid-staging
gid-processed
gid-test
```

## 3. Clean Up Buckets

When a bucket is no longer needed, delete it to stay organized.
Delete the `gid-test` bucket.

```python
s3.delete_bucket(Bucket='gid-test')

response = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])
```

Sample output:

```
gid-staging
gid-processed
```


## 4. Rename Buckets

If your project name changes, update your bucket names to match.
In our case, we need to change the bucket prefix from `gim-` to `gid-`.

```python
response = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    if 'gim' in bucket['Name']:
        s3.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket['Name'])

s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-staging')
s3.create_bucket(Bucket='gid-processed')

response = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])
```

## 5. Upload and Retrieve Files

Once the buckets are ready, upload the files.
Make sure to confirm that the upload is successful.

```python
s3.upload_file(Bucket='gid-staging',
               Filename='final_report.csv',
               Key='2019/final_report_01_01.csv')

response = s3.head_object(Bucket='gid-staging',
                          Key='2019/final_report_01_01.csv')
print(response['ContentLength'])
```

Expected output:

```
209
```


## 6. Delete Files with Prefix

Record retention has been a huge issue, so we need to ensure that records are not kept past the mandated retention dates. Remove all files from 2018 to stay compliant. 

```python
response = s3.list_objects(Bucket='gid-staging', Prefix='2018/final_')

if 'Contents' in response:
    for obj in response['Contents']:
        s3.delete_object(Bucket='gid-staging', Key=obj['Key'])

response = s3.list_objects(Bucket='gid-staging')
for obj in response['Contents']:
    print(obj['Key'])
```

Sample output:

```
2019/final_report_01_00
2019/final_report_01_01
2019/final_report_01_02
2019/final_report_01_03
2019/final_report_01_04
```

## 7. Upload Public Reports

To ensure transparency, publish the aggregate reports and make them publicly available.

```python
s3.upload_file(
  Filename='./final_report.csv',
  Key='2019/final_report_2019_02_20.csv',
  Bucket='gid-staging',
  ExtraArgs={'ACL': 'public-read'}
)
```

Additionally, make all aggregated reports since the beginning of 2019 public as well.

```python
response = s3.list_objects(Bucket='gid-staging', Prefix='2019/final_')

for obj in response['Contents']:
    s3.put_object_acl(Bucket='gid-staging', Key=obj['Key'], ACL='public-read')
    print("https://{}.s3.amazonaws.com/{}".format('gid-staging', obj['Key']))
```

Sample output:

```
https://gid-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/final_report_01_00.csv
https://gid-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/final_report_01_01.csv
https://gid-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/final_report_01_02.csv
```

This lets anyone access your reports directly through their browsers.

## 8. Share Private Files 

As a special request, the client asked to prioritize and keep reports from a specific district confidential, as they want to review them before the information goes public. 

To handle this, we need to share the private report securely and only for a short time.

```python
share_url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
  ClientMethod='get_object',
  ExpiresIn=3600,
  Params={'Bucket': 'gid-staging', 'Key': 'final_report.csv'}
)
print(share_url)
```

Sample output:

```
https://gid-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/final_report.csv?AWSAccessKeyId=FakeKey&Signature=ExampleSignature&Expires=1760943615
```


## 9. Read Private Files into Pandas

Add up all requests starting from 2019 to identify the overall trend. To achieve this, youâ€™ll need to read the daily CSV files stored in the `gid-requests` bucket and combine them into one dataset.

The files in `gid-requests` are private, meaning only you can access them through your credentials, while they remain hidden from the public.

The boto3 S3 client is already initialized and stored in the `s3` variable, and the list of objects in `gid-requests` is available in the `response` variable.

```python
df_list = []

for file in response['Contents']:
    obj = s3.get_object(Bucket='gid-requests', Key=file['Key'])
    obj_df = pd.read_csv(obj['Body'])
    df_list.append(obj_df)

df = pd.concat(df_list)
df.head()
```

Sample output:

```
        service_name  request_count
0  72 Hour Violation              8
1   Graffiti Removal              2
2  Missed Collection             12
3   Street Light Out             21
4            Pothole             33
```

## 10. Generate HTML Tables from Pandas

The client asked to generate a table of all the services in the system. The system is dynamic and grows on a weekly basis, adding additional services. The DataFrame of available services are loaded into the `services_df` variable:

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/getitdone.png)

</div>

```python
## HTML table with no border and selected columns
services_df.to_html('./services_no_border.html',
                    columns=['service_name', 'link'],
                    border=0)

## HTML table with border and all columns
services_df.to_html('./services_border_all_columns.html', border=1)
```


## 11. Hosts HTML Dashboards on S3

A dashboard html file was generated to be used tro schedule the client's staff accordingly. 

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/getitdone-2.png)

</div>

Make sure the generated HTML File is continuously updated and serve it as a website.

```python
s3.upload_file(Filename='dashboard.html',
               Bucket='getitdone-public',
               Key='index.html',
               ExtraArgs={'ContentType': 'text/html', 'ACL': 'public-read'})

print("http://{}.s3.amazonaws.com/{}".format('getitdone-public', 'index.html'))
```

Sample output:

```
http://getitdone-public.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
```
