## Overview 

Boto3 is the Python library used to interact with AWS. It lets us manage AWS services using code instead of the console.

- Import boto3 to start using it
- Service name refers to any AWS service like S3, EC2, or IAM
- Region defines where your AWS resources live
- Access key and secret key act like a username and password

Some AWS services often used with Boto3.

- **IAM** manages user access
- **S3** stores and retrieves data in the cloud
- **SNS** sends notifications like emails or SMS
- **Comprehend** analyzes text for sentiment or meaning
- **Rekognition** detects objects or text in images
- **RDS**, **EC2**, and **Lambda** manage databases, virtual machines, and serverless functions
