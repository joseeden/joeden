## Overview

Managing cloud costs requires planning and monitoring. There are a few simple steps to follow.

- Understand where costs come from
- Set budget goals with alerts
- Take action if budgets are exceeded

## Cost Explorer

The Cost Explorer helps you see and track costs over time.

- View charges by day, service, account, or tag
- Forecast future spending based on past usage
- Free tool for basic cost analysis

It gives a clear picture of spending trends but does not provide detailed item-level charges or budgeting features.

## Budgets in Action

Budgets help monitor and manage expenses.

- Create custom budgets for services or accounts
- Track spending against goals
- Get alerts when limits are close

With budgets in place, you can take quick action to avoid overspending.

## Respond with Actions

Budgets can trigger automatic responses when limits are exceeded.

- Send alerts through email or SNS
- Trigger AWS Lambda functions for automation
- Stop or restrict new resources when needed

This helps prevent costs from going out of control by automating responses to budget breaches.

## Guidelines for Budgets

Budgets only work well if they are planned carefully.

- Base budgets on accurate business needs
- Consider all related costs
- Keep goals clear and purposeful

Good planning ensures budgets are useful and avoid sending irrelevant alerts.

## Billing Conductor

Billing Conductor organizes and splits costs by groups.

- Assign spending to teams, projects, or users
- Break down costs into smaller units
- Use detailed reports for accountability

This is useful when multiple teams share resources but need individual cost tracking.

## Reserved Instance Flexibility

Reserved Instances give savings with long-term commitments.

- Lock in discounts by committing to usage
- Flexibility to change sizes within the same family
- Savings apply based on a normalization table

For example:

```text
2 x m3.medium RIs = 1 x m3.large RI
```

This flexibility makes Reserved Instances more adaptable while still keeping discounts in place.
