## Overview

Using cost optimization strategies can greatly reduce cloud expenses. Below are the main ways to achieve savings.

- Use resources correctly
- Scale capacity based on demand
- Explore pricing models and alternatives

With the right approach, costs can go down without losing performance.

## Cost Optimization Framework

There are five main steps to optimize cloud spending.

- Right-size resources for the job
- Scale elastically to match demand
- Use pricing models like Reserved or Spot
- Replace with lower-cost services where possible
- Remove unused storage to cut costs

These steps ensure resources are efficient and expenses stay under control.

## Sample Scenario 

Consider the example below:

A company runs 12 servers, a database, and storage for about $15,000 each month.

- Four servers for web requests
- Four for image processing
- Four for analytics tasks

Each set was sized for peak demand, which leaves room for optimization.

### Optimize size and capacity

Web servers do not all need to run 24/7.

- One server must stay on at all times
- Extra servers are only needed during traffic spikes
- Usage shows only 24 server-hours are required for surges

With auto scaling, the company can save nearly half of its server time.

```bash
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group \
  --auto-scaling-group-name web-scaling-group \
  --launch-configuration-name web-launch \
  --min-size 1 \
  --max-size 4
```

Expected result: One server always runs, and more start only when traffic increases.

### Leverage pricing model

On the other hand, analytics servers run constantly but can tolerate interruptions.

- On-demand costs about $4,000/month
- Spot instances offer 66% lower prices
- Moving to spot saves up to 94%

To optimize: Switch to Spot instances. This keeps analytics running while reducing cost.

### Explore alternatives

Some workloads run better on different services.

- AWS Lambda runs short tasks without servers
- Great for image processing or uploads
- One million free requests per month

Replacing 4 EC2 servers with Lambda can save $4,000 monthly while still processing tasks reliably.

### Optimize storage

Storage costs increase if unused files are left behind.

- Lifecycle policies can purge old data
- Auto-purge rules save time
- Cuts $500/month from costs

Using lifecycle rules keeps storage lean and prevents wasted expenses.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket mybucket \
  --lifecycle-configuration '{
    "Rules": [{
      "ID": "ExpireOldFiles",
      "Prefix": "",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Expiration": {"Days": 30}
    }]
  }'
```

Expected result: Files older than 30 days are automatically deleted.

### Savings Summary

By applying all strategies, costs drop from $15,000 to about $4,722 each month.

- Elastic capacity saved server hours
- Spot pricing cut analytics costs
- Lambda replaced EC2 for short tasks
- Storage policies reduced waste

The savings show how cost optimization can transform cloud spending when applied to real workloads.
