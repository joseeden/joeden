## Security Features 

AWS Loadbalacers can automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets.

- Handles the varying load of application traffic.
- Offers different types of Loadbalancers 
    - Network Loadbalancers 
    - Application Loadbalancers 
    - Classic Loadbalancers
    - Gateway Loadbalancers
- Provides some security features such as security policies.

## Security Policy of HTTPS Listeners

When you create a TLS Listener, you must select a security policy which can be updated as needed. To learn more, check out the following links:

- [User Guide for Network Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/index.html)
- [User Guide for Gateway Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/index.html)
- [User Guide for Classic Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/index.html)
- [TLS listeners for your Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html)

## TLS/SSL Termination Options

TLS/SSL can be terminated in either:

- ELB 
- EC2/ECS/EKS/Fargate (behind the loadbalancer)

To terminate the TLS/SSL behind the loadbalancer, you can only use:

- Network Loadbalancer 
- Classic Loadbalancer with TCP protocol support for termination

Security implications of terminating TLS/SSL in the ELB:

- ELB will decrypt TLS/SSL so traffic between ELB and EC2/ECS/EKS will be unencryptesd
- you will not have end-to-end encryption in place 

Benefits of termination TLS/SSL in the ELB:

- Offloads processing to the ELB 
- Faster and less resources needed in the EC2/ECS/EKS/Fargate

**NOTE:**
Do not terminate the TLS/SSL in the ELB unless you really need to.
