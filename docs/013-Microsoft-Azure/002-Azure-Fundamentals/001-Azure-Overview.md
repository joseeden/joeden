## Overview 

Microsoft Azure is a collection of online services for application development and hosting. 

- Eliminates the need for personal data centers; operates in Microsoft's global data centers.
- Pay-as-you-go model based on actual usage.
- Flexible resource scaling up and down as needed.

- Azure App Service for web and mobile applications.
- Azure Functions for serverless execution of individual functions.
- Azure Container Instances for simplified container deployment.
- Azure Kubernetes Service for managing multi-container applications.

### Storage Solutions

- Blob Storage for unstructured data with hot, cool, and archive access tiers.
- Azure File Storage for hierarchical file storage.
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for Hadoop-compatible storage in data analytics.

### Database Services

- Azure SQL Database for relational databases.
- Azure Database for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL for open-source databases.
- Cosmos DB for globally scalable NoSQL databases.
- Azure Cache for Redis for caching frequently requested data.

### Network Services

- Virtual Networks (VNets) for VMs with IP addresses, subnets, and route definitions.
- VNet peering for communication between VMs in different VNets.
- VPN or Azure ExpressRoute for secure connections to on-premises networks.

### Additional Services

- Beyond core compute, storage, and networking, Azure offers services in areas like artificial intelligence and DevOps.

  

## Comparison of AWS and Azure Services

| TOPIC      | AWS                                      | AZURE                          | FUNCTIONALITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Compute    | Amazon EC2                               | Azure Virtual Machines         | Manage your own virtual machines, IaaS, this is the services you are looking at.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            | AWS Lambda                               | Azure Function                 | Need to execute a bit of code, but you don’t need a dedicated virtual machine for that. You can go server-less and use Azure functions or Lambda.                                                                                                     |

|            | Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)  | AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) | Kubernetes as a service, with the dedicated virtual machine cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Storage    | Amazon S3 (Simple storage service)       | Azure Blob Storage             | To store files.

|            | Amazon ElastiCache                       | Azure Cache for Redis          | When your application could use a distributed caching layer with low latency. This is PaaS, so you don’t need to worry about maintaining the cache cluster.                                                                                           |

| Networking | Amazon VPC (Virtual private cloud)       | Virtual Networks (VNet)        | Azure you have the concept of VNets, the major difference is that in AWS most services can be easily added into a VNet.                                                                                                                               |

|            | Amazon API Gateway                       | API Management                 | Concept of API gateways, rather than having one client having to know about many backend services, you can add an API Gateway layer                                                                                                                   |
|            | Amazon CloudFront                        | Azure CDN                      | Content delivery networks are important when performance is key for your web applications. Rather than leaving your static files in your application virtual machines, we can use a dedicated resource for handling content distribution and caching. |
| Integration| AWS SQS                                  | Azure Service Bus              | When you have a simple queue, one publisher and one consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Subscriptions and Billing 

When you sign up for Azure, Microsoft creates a billing account and a subscription. These are easily confused, as both are related to billing. 

### Subscription

- A subscription is a collection of Azure resources and are charged in the same monthly bill.
- It serves as the basis for billing, allowing Microsoft to charge for the resources used in Azure.
- Each resource created in Azure is linked to a subscription, and it's possible to have multiple subscriptions.
- However, each resource can only belong to one subscription.

### Billing Account

- To facilitate billing, a billing account is needed, containing payment details like credit card information. 
- Each subscription must be linked to one billing account, but multiple subscriptions can be linked to a single billing account, making it easier to manage costs.

Reasons for having both:

- Multiple subscriptions within a billing account for departmental invoicing.
- Isolation of resources in different subscriptions for security or compliance.

### Subscription Types

**1. Free Trial Subscription**

    - Offers limited free usage of certain Azure services each month.
    - Provides a $200 credit for other Azure services.
    - The credit is valid for 30 days, and after that, an upgrade to pay-as-you-go is required.
    - Only one free trial per customer is allowed.
    - After 12 months, the monthly allotment of free services ends.

**2. Pay-As-You-Go Subscription**

    - Allows payment for Azure resources as they are used.
    - No long-term commitment or contract is required.
    - Offers flexibility with consumption-based-billing.

**3. Member Offers Subscription**

    - Provides reduced rates for Azure services for certain groups (e.g., MSDN Platform subscribers).
    - Offers discounts and benefits for eligible members.

**4. Reservations**

    - Committing to one-year or three-year plans.
    - Significantly reduce costs and ensure resource availability.
    - Reservations can cut costs by up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.
    - Ideal for consistent, long-term resource usage.
    - Similar to booking a hotel room in advance, it secures resources at a lower rate for a set period.
  

### Purchasing Options

**1. Web Direct**

    - Directly purchase Azure subscriptions through the Azure website.

**2. Enterprise Agreement (EA)**

    - Suitable for organizations purchasing a significant amount of Microsoft products and services.
    - Involves a negotiated agreement with substantial discounts.
    - Requires a long-term commitment (minimum three years) to use Microsoft products and services.

**3. Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)**

    - An option for running custom third-party solutions on Azure.
    - Purchased through Microsoft partners known as Cloud Solution Providers.
    - Partners bill for both Azure services and their own solutions, providing technical support.

### Purchasing Third-Party Solutions

- For custom third-party solutions: Consider purchasing through a Cloud Solution Provider.
- For off-the-shelf third-party solutions: Access the Azure Marketplace after obtaining an Azure subscription.
- Azure Marketplace offers virtual machine images from various vendors that can be quickly deployed.
