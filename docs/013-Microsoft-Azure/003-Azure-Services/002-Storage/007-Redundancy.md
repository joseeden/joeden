## Redundancy Options 

Azure Storage provides six redundancy options, ranging from locally-redundant to read-access geo-zone-redundant storage. Each option offers different levels of redundancy and pricing.

Note that not all of these options are available in every region or for every type of data.


### Locally-Redundant Storage (LRS)

- **Replication:** Across racks in the same data center.
- **Disaster Consideration:** Data could be lost in a data center disaster.
- **Recommendation:** Use only if data reconstruction is easily achievable.

### Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)

- **Replication:** Across three zones within one region.
- **Disaster Consideration:** Ensures data availability even if an entire zone goes down.

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)

- **Replication:** Across two regions.
- **Disaster Consideration:** Requires geo-failover in the event of a regional disaster to access data in the secondary region.

### Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)

- **Replication:** Same as GRS.
- **Additional Feature:** Allows reading data immediately from the secondary region in case of a disaster in the primary region.
- **Write Access:** Not available until Microsoft restores availability in the primary region.

### Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)

- **Replication:** Across three availability zones in the primary region.
- **Difference from GRS:** Combines zone-redundant storage and geo-redundant storage.

### Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)

- **Replication:** Same as GZRS.
- **Additional Feature:** Allows immediate reading from the secondary region in case of a disaster in the primary region.
- **Write Access:** Not available until Microsoft restores availability in the primary region.

## Redundancy Pricing 

Naturally, each of these redundancy options has a different price. 

- Locally-redundant storage being the cheapest and 
- Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage being the most expensive. 
- RA-GRS is actually more expensive than GZRS even though itâ€™s less redundant because it provides instant access to your data in the secondary region.
