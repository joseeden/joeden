## VPN Gateway

A VPN Gateway is a specialized virtual network gateway used for encrypted network traffic over the public internet, connecting:

- Azure virtual network to on-premises network
- Azure virtual network to another Azure virtual network

Note that oly one VPN gateway can be defined per virtual network, but it can support multiple connections.

**How it works**

    - Azure deploys at least two hidden VMs in a specified gateway subnet.
    - Hidden VMs contain routing tables and gateway services.
    - VMs are not visible or configurable by users.
    - Deployment of VPN gateways can take up to 45 minutes to complete.

**Gateway Types**

    - "VPN" type for typical VPN connections.
    - "ExpressRoute" for configuring an ExpressRoute connection.

**After Deployment**

    - Create an IPSec or IKE VPN tunnel between the newly deployed vNet gateway and other gateways.
    - vNet-to-vNet connection to another VPN gateway in Azure.
    - Site-to-site connection to an on-premises VPN device.
    - Point-to-site connection for remote location access.

## Point-to-Site VPNs

A Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateway connection securely links a single client computer to an Azure virtual network, often used by remote workers.

### Protocols

- **OpenVPN Protocol**
  - SSL/TLS-based, traverses firewalls through TCP port 443 outbound.
  - Compatible with Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX.

- **Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP)**
  - Proprietary VPN protocol leveraging TLS.
  - Penetrates firewalls, but supports only Windows devices.

- **IKEv2 VPN**
  - Standards-based IPSec VPN solution.
  - Suitable for connecting from Mac OSX devices.

### Authentication Methods

- **Azure Certificate Authentication**
  - Requires a client certificate on the device, validated by the VPN gateway during the connection handshake.

- **Azure AD Authentication**
  - Users connect using Azure AD credentials, supported only for OpenVPN protocol.
  - Windows 10 necessitates the Azure VPN Client for compatibility.

- **Traditional AD Domain Authentication**
  - Users in a traditional AD domain are authenticated via a RADIUS server integrated with the domain controller.

### Gateway SKUs Supporting P2S VPNs

For more information, please see [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about).

| Gateway SKU           | P2S VPN Support |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Standard              | Yes             |
| HighPerformance       | Yes             |
| VpnGw1                | Yes             |
| VpnGw2                | Yes             |
| VpnGw3                | Yes             |


## Site-to-Site VPNs


![](/img/docs/azure-vnet-s2s-vpn-with-border.png)


Site-to-Site VPN gateways bridge on-premises networks to Azure virtual networks, establishing a secure IPSec or IKE VPN tunnel.

### Creating the Connection

1. **Azure Virtual Network Setup**
   - Create the Azure virtual network that will connect to your on-prem network.

2. **Gateway Subnet and VPN Gateway Creation**
   - Establish a gateway subnet within your virtual network.
   - Create the VPN gateway (may take up to 45 minutes).

3. **Local Network Gateway Setup**
   - Set up the local network gateway, symbolizing the on-premises endpoint.

4. **Configuration of On-Prem VPN Device**
   - Customize the on-premises VPN device configuration.

5. **Azure VPN Connection Deployment**
   - Deploy the VPN connection in Azure.

6. **Verification of Connection**
   - Verify the connection to ensure a seamless and secure link.

## Routing Options for VPNs

Two types of routing:

- **Policy-based**
  - Route-based is more robust and the only supported option for point-to-site connections.

- **Route-based**
  - Does not support point-to-site connections from the same VPN Gateway.
  - Only one VPN Gateway is allowed per virtual network; creating another virtual network may be necessary.

For a direct connection without internet flow and more bandwidth, use Azure ExpressRoute.
