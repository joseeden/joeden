## Overview

Azure Load Balancers are composed of several key components that work together to manage incoming network traffic efficiently. These components ensure:

- Effective load balancing of network traffic.
- Optimization of application availability.
- Seamless communication between clients and backend resources.

## Frontend IP Configuration

This component is the main point of contact for clients accessing the load-balanced application.

- Represents the access point for clients.
- Can be either a private or public IP address, depending on the load balancer type.
- Supports multiple Frontend IP addresses.

## Backend Pool

The backend pool handles incoming requests and consists of various VMs or instances.

- A collection of VMs or instances within a scale set designed to manage incoming requests.
- Automatically adjusts when instances are added or removed, ensuring optimal traffic distribution.

## Health Probes

Health probes check the status and readiness of the instances in the backend pool.

- Assesses the health of instances and their readiness to handle traffic.
- Identifies which instances are healthy and capable of receiving traffic.
- Prevents traffic from being routed to unhealthy instances.

## Load Balancing Rules

These rules define how incoming traffic is distributed across the backend pool.

- Specifies how inbound traffic should be distributed among backend instances.
- Example: A rule for port 80 (HTTP) that routes traffic from the frontend IP to port 80 on backend instances.

## High Availability Ports

High availability ports enable protocol-agnostic load balancing for all ports.

- Configures a rule for 'protocol - all and port - 0.'
- Facilitates load balancing for all TCP and UDP flows across all ports of an internal standard load balancer.

## Inbound NAT Rules

Inbound NAT rules manage traffic forwarding from specific IP and port combinations to backend instances.

- Forwards traffic with specific frontend IP and port combinations to designated VMs or instances.
- Useful for scenarios like RDP connections to multiple VMs behind a load balancer.

## Outbound Rules

Outbound rules handle network address translation for outbound traffic from backend VMs.

- Configures outbound network address translation (NAT) for all VMs within the backend pool.
- Enables outbound communication to the Internet.
- Supported only on the Standard Load Balancer.
- Not available on the Basic Load Balancer.
