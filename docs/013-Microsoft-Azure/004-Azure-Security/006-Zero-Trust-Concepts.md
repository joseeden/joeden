## Zero Trust

In the realm of cybersecurity, the traditional approach of relying solely on perimeter defenses to keep networks secure is deemed insufficient.

</div>

A paradigm shift to a "**zero trust**" model is advocated, where trust is not automatically granted based on location or network boundaries. Microsoft employs specific principles in its zero-trust architecture, emphasizing a more secure and robust approach.

## Key Principles of Zero Trust

### 1. Verify Explicitly

- **Identity Verification**

    - Base user access on comprehensive identity verification.
    - Authentication factors include user ID and password, device status, and location.

- **Conditional Access**

    - Implement conditional access policies based on various data points.
    - Consider user behavior and location before granting access.
    - Utilize tools like Identity Protection for enhanced security.
    
- **Administrator Access**

    - Exercise extra precautions, especially with administrator access.
    - Leverage services like Privileged Identity Management for controlled and monitored access.

### 2. Use "Least Privilege" Access

    
- **Minimal Access**

    - Grant the minimum level of access required for specific tasks.
    - Adopt the [principle of least privilege](/docs/007-Cybersecurity/006-Identity-and-Access-Management/005-IAM-Concepts.md#principle-of-least-privilege) to limit potential damage.

- **Role-Based Access**

    - Assign roles tailored to specific tasks.
    - For instance, grant SQL DB Contributor role instead of broader permissions.

- **Administrator Access Control**

    - Exercise caution with administrator access.
    - Implement just-in-time access through Privileged Identity Management.

### 3. Assume Breach

    
- **Designing for Breach**

    - Assume compromise of network or identities.
    - Design architecture to mitigate and limit damage in case of an attack.
    
- **Minimizing Blast Radius**

    - Control access for each infrastructure element independently.
    - Restricting access to one element should not grant access to others.
    
- **Additional Security Measures**

    - Run threat detection services to identify and respond to breaches.
    - Ensure encryption for all network traffic to heighten the complexity for attackers.

## Zero Trust Architecture

A Zero Trust approach extends throughout the entire digital estate and serves as an integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy.

This illustration provides a representation of the primary elements that contribute to Zero Trust.

## Defense in Depth 

Implementing a zero-trust philosophy in your Azure infrastructure involves a strategic approach known as **defense in depth**. This strategy focuses on safeguarding data by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

<div class="img-center">

</div>

The goal is to create multiple layers of protection so that even if one layer is breached, others remain resilient, slowing down attackers and increasing the likelihood of detection.

### Three Types of Data Protection

- **Confidentiality** - Ensures only authorized users can access the data.

- **Integrity** - Guarantees the data has not been altered by malicious users.

- **Availability** - Ensures authorized users can access the data, defending against denial-of-service attacks.


### Layers of Defense in Depth in Azure

- **Physical Security**

    - Managed by Microsoft at datacenters.
    - Least likely layer for attackers to target.

- **Identity and Access**

    - Provided by Azure Active Directory and role-based access control.
    - Enhanced security through features like conditional access and Identity Protection.

- **Perimeter Security**

    - Azure DDoS defense defends against denial-of-service attacks- .

- **Network Security**

    - Network security groups establish firewall rules for Azure virtual networks- .

- **Compute Layer**

    - Regularly patch operating systems, managed automatically in many Azure compute services.
    - Requires manual patching for services like virtual machines.

- **Application Security**

    - Ensures developers write applications securely.
    - Involves secure coding practices and adherence to security guidelines.

- **Data Layer**

    - Azure storage services offer security features, including encryption.
    - Implement Advanced Threat Protection in Azure SQL Databases.

### Comprehensive Data Protection

- **Multi-Layered Security**

    - Combines Microsoft's responsibilities (e.g., physical security) with user responsibilities (e.g., application security).

- **Increased Detection Probability**

    - Slows down attackers and enhances the likelihood of detecting security breaches.

- **Collaborative Effort**

    - Utilizes a combination of Azure services and user implementation to fortify data protection.
