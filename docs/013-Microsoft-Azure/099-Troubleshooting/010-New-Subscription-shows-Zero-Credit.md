## Problem

If your Azure subscription shows $0.00 credit, it's likely because the free trial or credit hasn't been applied yet. 

## Possible Reasons

- **Delay in Activation**  
  - Free credit can take up to 24 hours to show  
  - It may not appear immediately in the portal

- **Wrong Billing Scope**  
  - You might be checking the wrong billing view  
  - Happens if you have access to more than one

- **Existing Subscription**  
  - You may not qualify for a new trial  
  - Especially if you’ve used a free trial before

- **System Issue**  
  - Rare backend issues can block credits  
  - Seen in support forums like Microsoft Q&A

## What You Can Do

- **Wait and Refresh**  
  - Give it 24 hours, then check again

- **Check Billing View**  
  - Switch to the correct billing scope if needed

- **Verify Subscription**  
  - Confirm you’re viewing the right subscription

- **Contact Support**  
  - If nothing works, open a ticket with Azure support

In most cases, this is a temporary issue. Checking your billing scope and waiting a bit usually solves it.
