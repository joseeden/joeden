## Overview

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the oldest and biggest cloud services available. It has some unique strengths that make it different from others.

- Global reach
- Strong open-source support

GCP uses the same powerful backbone as Google Search and YouTube, which gives businesses speed, reliability, and flexibility. Many tech giants offer cloud services, but GCP has special advantages.

- Large global network
- Strong focus on collaboration

Google owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, and its open-source focus helps businesses cut costs while innovating faster.


## Who Uses GCP

GCP is trusted by both startups and global enterprises.

- Small businesses
- Fortune 500 companies

By offering modern infrastructure to all, GCP helps businesses of any size embrace digital transformation.

## Core Components

Every cloud platform is built on storage and compute. GCP offers key services for both.

- **Cloud Storage** for files and objects
- **Cloud SQL** for relational databases
- **Compute Engine** for virtual machines
- **App Engine** for web apps
- **Vertex AI** for building and running AI models

These services form the backbone of GCP and support everything else that runs on the platform.

## A Secure Framework

GCP storage and compute services are designed with security in mind.

- Strong encryption for all data
- Secure foundation for advanced services

This strong base ensures that higher-level services like analytics and AI run safely and smoothly.
