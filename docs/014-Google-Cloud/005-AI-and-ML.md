## Overview

**Artificial Intelligence** is defined as the ability of machines to mimic human thinking and decision-making. **Machine Learning**, a branch of AI, enables machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

- AI simulates human problem-solving
- ML improves performance automatically over time
- Machines adapt without needing explicit programming for every task

AI and ML allow machines to handle complex tasks while improving accuracy over time.

## Data Quality in ML

ML models rely on the data they are trained with. High-quality data ensures better predictions.

- Data should be clean, relevant, and up-to-date
- Poor data leads to inaccurate predictions
- Good data improves reliability and trust in ML models

Quality data is key because ML models reflect the data they learn from.

## GCP AI and ML Tools

GCP offers AI and ML solutions built on a fast and reliable global network. These tools are usable by beginners and experts alike.

- Pre-built models for easy integration
- Scalable infrastructure for AI workloads
- Tools that work with all GCP storage and compute services

## Pre-Trained Models

GCP provides models that are ready to use for images, videos, and text analysis.

- **Vision AI** detects objects and reads handwriting
- **Video AI** extracts metadata and identifies objects
- **Natural Language AI** analyzes text and sentiment

These pre-built models save time and cost, letting businesses add AI capabilities quickly.
