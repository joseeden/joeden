## Being Cloud Native

As defined by [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/about/charter/) 

> *Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.*
>
> *These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.*

In its simplest terms, **Cloud native** refers to building and managing applications at scale using either private, public, or hybrid cloud platforms.

Now, when we hear containers, it is also often followed by another buzzword: **microservices**.

## Microservices

**Microservices** are small, independent, and containerized applications, each handling a specific function and running as separate processes.

- Independent Development and Deployment
  - Services can be developed and updated separately
  - Faster release cycles without impacting other services

- Scalability and Flexibility
  - Services scale individually based on demand
  - Allows for diverse tech stacks across services

- Fault Isolation
  - Failure in one service doesn't affect the whole system
  - Resilient to partial failures, reducing downtime
