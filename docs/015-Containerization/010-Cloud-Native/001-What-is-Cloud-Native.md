As defined by [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/about/charter/) 

> *Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.*
>
> *These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.*

In its simplest terms, **Cloud native** refers to building and managing applications at scale using either private, public, or hybrid cloud platforms.

Now, when we hear containers, it is also often followed by another buzzword: **microservices**.

## Microservices 

**Microservices** are simply a collection of small, independent, and containerized applications. Read below to learn about the difference between monolitic applications and microservices.

We'll get to explore how microservices ties in with Cloud-native in the labs.
