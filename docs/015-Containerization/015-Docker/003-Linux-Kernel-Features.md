## Chroot 

The `chroot` jail is essential for isolating processes by restricting them to a specific directory, hiding the rest of the filesystem.

- Important for security  
- Introduced in the 1970s, it remains a fundamental security measure for applications.
- Evolved into Linux kernel namespaces.

## Modern Linux Features  

Docker utilizes several modern Linux features to enhance its architecture:

- Namespaces
- Control Groups
- UnionFS

## Namespaces

Namespaces provide process isolation by logically separating a system's resources. Types of namespaces include:

- **PID Namespace**  
  - Ensures unique process IDs per namespace.  
  - Isolates process management across namespaces.

- **Net Namespace**  
  - Isolates network settings for each namespace.  
  - Allows independent IP addresses and routing.

- **IPC Namespace**  
  - Prevents interference in interprocess communication.  
  - Ensures isolated messaging between processes.

- **MNT Namespace**  
  - Provides distinct filesystem views per namespace.  
  - Manages separate mount points for containers.

- **UTS Namespace**  
  - Isolates system identifiers like hostname.  
  - Keeps kernel version distinct per namespace.

## Control Groups

Control groups (cgroups) help Docker allocate and limit resources to prevent resource monopolization by any process.

- **Resource Limiting**  
  - Set maximum memory thresholds for groups.  
  - Prevent overconsumption of system resources.

- **Prioritization**  
  - Allocate CPU and disk I/O to critical groups.  
  - Ensure priority access for essential processes.

- **Accounting**  
  - Track and report resource usage per group.  
  - Provide insights into resource consumption.

- **Control**  
  - Manage or freeze process groups as needed.  
  - Adjust based on resource requirements.

## UnionFS

UnionFS manages container sizes by overlaying changes on a base image, optimizing storage efficiency.

- **Merging**  
  - Combines changes from multiple layers using overlay filesystems.  
  - Keeps the overall size manageable.

- **Read/Write**  
  - Designates branches as read-only (RO) or read-write (RW).  
  - Facilitates efficient data handling in containers.

**How it works:**

- When creating a container, it starts with a base image comprising a set of files.
- Adding or removing packages generates new layers representing file changes.
- UnionFS merges these layers, creating an efficient, unified filesystem for the container.
