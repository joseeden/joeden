## Tags for Versioning

Tagging allows you to label specific versions of an image, which is crucial for deployment and rollback.

- Simplifies tracking changes in image versions.
- Facilitates reverting to previous versions if issues arise.

## Tags as Aliases

Tags serve as aliases for Docker images, helping to identify different builds. If no tag is provided, Docker automatically assigns a "latest" tag.

- Improves organization by categorizing builds.
- Makes it easier to reference specific versions when deploying.

## Tags Must Be ASCII Character Strings

Tags can consist of letters, digits, underscores, periods, and dashes, with restrictions on format.

- Must not start with a period or a dash.
- Can be up to 128 characters long.

## Images Can Have More Than One Tag

Docker images can be assigned multiple tags, which may appear as separate images but reference the same image ID.

- Offers flexibility in managing and deploying different versions.
- Makes it easy to switch between versions without creating duplicates.

## Tag Before Pushing the Image to a Container Registry

It is advisable to tag your image before pushing it to a Docker registry to avoid using random IDs.

- Ensures images are properly identified in the registry.
- Helps maintain consistency and clarity in versioning.
