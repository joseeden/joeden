## Overview

Docker Compose is a tool that helps define and manage multi-container applications with the Docker engine. It simplifies configuration and deployment using a single file.  

- Configuration is stored in `compose.yml` or `compose.yaml`.  
- Older formats use `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yaml`.  
- Makes it easy to share or demo applications.  

Hereâ€™s a comparison between running multiple containers using individual `RUN` commands and using Docker Compose.

- **First Method - Multiple RUNs**

    ```bash
    docker run voting-app
    docker run redis
    docker run worker
    docker run db
    docker run result-app
    ```

- **Second Method - Using Docker Compose**

    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yml
    services:
        web:
            image: "voting-app"
        cache:
            image: "db"
        messaging:
            image: "worker"
        db:
            image: "db"
        result:
            image: "result-app"
    ```

The second method is cleaner and more organized. To run the entire stack defined in `docker-compose.yml`, execute:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

:::info[NOTE]

**Note**: This command is applicable only for multiple containers on a **single Docker host**.

## Adding More Details 

You can enhance the `docker-compose.yml` file with additional configurations:

```yaml
services:
  redis:
      image: "redis"
  db:
      image: postgres:9.4
  vote:
      build: ./vote
      ports:
          - 5000:80
      links:
          - redis
  result:
      build: ./result
      ports:
          - 5001:80
      links:
          - db
  worker:
      image: worker
      links:
          - db
          - redis
```


## Docker Compose Versions

There are three versions of a Docker Compose file. For versions 2 and 3, you must specify the version.

- **Version 1**

    All containers are attached to the default bridge network and use links for communication.

    ```yaml
    redis:
        image: redis
    db:
        image: postgres:9.4
    vote:
        image: voting-app
        ports:
            - 5000:80
        links:
            - redis
    ```

- **Version 2**

    A dedicated network is automatically created for the application, and containers can have dependencies.

    ```yaml
    version: '2'
    services:
        redis:
            image: redis
        db:
            image: postgres:9.4
        vote:
            image: voting-app
            ports:
                - 5000:80
            depends_on:
                - redis
    ```

- **Version 3**

    Similar to version 2 but includes support for Docker Swarm.

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
        redis:
            image: redis
        db:
            image: postgres:9.4
        vote:
            image: voting-app
            ports:
                - 5000:80
    ```


## Docker Compose Commands

The **docker-compose** commands outlined here are essential for managing your containerized applications. The `--build` option rebuilds the images specified in the docker-compose file before starting the containers.

To start an application, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file.  

- Run the following command:  

  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```

- For older systems, use:  

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- Use the `-f` option to specify a file with a different name or location:  

  ```bash
  docker compose -f custom-file.yaml up
  ```

- Add `-d` to detach and run containers in the background:  

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```

    :::info 

    Running `docker compose up` creates containers and their network automatically.

    :::


- To view the running containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose ps 
    ```

    If executed in a directory without a docker-compose file, you'll see an error:

    ```bash
    ERROR:
            Can't find a suitable configuration file in this directory or any
            parent. Are you in the right directory?

            Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, compose.yml, compose.yaml 
    ```
    
- To shut down all running resources, including containers and networks:  

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

- Use the `-f` option if it was used during startup:  

  ```bash
  docker compose -f custom-file.yaml down
  ```
