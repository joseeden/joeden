## ReplicaSets

A **ReplicaSet** defines how many replicas (identical Pods) should run in the system at any time to ensure availability. It keeps the specified number of replicas stable.

We typically donâ€™t create ReplicaSets directly. Instead, we create **Deployments** and specify the number of replicas there.

To check or modify a deployment:

```bash
kubectl edit deployment -n kube-system
```

To view running ReplicaSets:

```bash
kubectl get rs -n kube-system
```

For more information, please see [ReplicaSets in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).



## Scaling

Scaling in Kubernetes is managed by the **Replication Controller**.

- Ensures the specified number of replicas stay running
- Replaces Pods if they fail, are deleted, or terminated
- Useful even with one Pod to ensure it is always active
