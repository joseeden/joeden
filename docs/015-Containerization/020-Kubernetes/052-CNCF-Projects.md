The **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** is an open-source, vendor-neutral organization that hosts key cloud-native projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus, aiming to make cloud-native computing universal and sustainable.

CNCF oversees projects that extend Kubernetes, offering additional capabilities. Some of these projects include:

- **CRI-O**: A container runtime for managing Kubernetes containers
- **CNI**: A pluggable network interface for Kubernetes
- **Jaeger**: An application operator for packaging, deploying, and managing apps
- **Rook**: A storage orchestrator for Kubernetes

CNCF defines project statuses as follows:

- **Sandbox**: New projects, mainly used by innovators
- **Incubating**: Projects being slowly adopted
- **Graduated**: Fully mature projects integrated into the Kubernetes ecosystem
