## Overview

For cloud-managed Kubernetes environments, minimizing IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles is important to follow the principle of least privilege and enhance security.


1. **Review Existing Roles**
   - Review the IAM roles linked to your Kubernetes cluster.
   
2. **Identify Unnecessary Permissions**
   - Check each IAM roleâ€™s permissions.
   - Remove any unnecessary permissions.

3. **Apply Least Privilege**
   - Assign only the minimum permissions required.
   - Avoid broad, overly permissive roles.

4. **Use Specific Roles for Specific Tasks**
   - Create roles for specific tasks, not general ones.
   - Tailor roles to different responsibilities.

5. **Regularly Audit IAM Roles**
   - Perform regular audits of IAM roles.
   - Remove unused roles and permissions.

6. **Implement Role Hierarchy**
   - Organize roles by responsibilities.
   - Link roles based on their scope.

7. **Use Managed Policies**
   - Use pre-configured managed policies when possible.
   - AWS, for example, offers managed policies for specific use cases.

8. **Utilize Service Accounts**
   - Assign IAM roles to Kubernetes Service Accounts.
   - Limit permissions for workloads with service accounts.

9. **Enable Session Policies**
   - Set limits on the duration and scope of IAM role sessions.
   - Restrict permissions using session policies.

10. **Rotate Credentials Regularly**
    - Rotate IAM credentials (keys, tokens) frequently.
    - Automate credential rotation for better security.

11. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**
    - Enable logging like AWS CloudTrail for IAM activities.
    - Monitor logs for unauthorized access or changes.

12. **Educate IAM Users**
    - Educate users on secure IAM practices.
    - Promote the use of temporary credentials when possible.


## Note

- IAM practices may vary by cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Align IAM roles with Kubernetes workload requirements.
- Document changes and test in non-production.
- Consider the impact on existing workloads before modifying IAM roles.
