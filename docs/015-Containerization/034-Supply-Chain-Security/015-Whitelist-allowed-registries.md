# Overview

To control image source security, we can leverage various options to restrict users from pulling images from unapproved registries.

- Deploy an Admission Webhook Server to validate image names.
- Use an OPA service with policies that enforce registry restrictions.
- Enable the **Image Policy Webhook** admission controller.


## Admission Webhook Server

An Admission Webhook Server can enforce custom policies to block or allow images based on registry sources. By setting up a webhook server:

- Each image name is inspected.
- Trusted registries are specified.
- Users are prevented from pulling unapproved images.

In the kubeconfig file, define the webhook configuration to validate image policies:

```yaml
## /etc/kubernetes/admission-config.yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: ImagePolicyWebhook
    configuration:
      imagePolicy:
        kubeConfigFile: /path/to/config/file
        allowTTL: 50
        denyTTL: 50
        retryBackoff: 500
        defaultAllow: true
```

This config enforces registry restrictions during the admission process.


## Open Policy Agent (OPA) for Registry Control

OPA allows you to enforce custom policies for image sources. By writing rules, you can ensure that images come only from trusted registries.

- Create flexible policies for registry restrictions.
- Configure as admission controller to enforce the rules.

An OPA policy could restrict images to specific registries:

```rego
package kubernetes.admission

default allow = false

allow {
  input.review.object.spec.containers[_].image == "trusted-registry.io/*"
}
```

OPA policies can be integrated with Kubernetes to extend control over image access.


## Built-In Image Policy Webhook

Kubernetes provides an **Image Policy Webhook** as a built-in admission controller that allows you to enforce registry controls without external dependencies.

To use the Image Policy Webhook, first enable it in the kube-apiserver configuration:

- Add `ImagePolicyWebhook` to the manifest or service file.

    ```yaml
    # In kube-apiserver manifest or service file
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,ImagePolicyWebhook,...
    ```

- Restart the kube-apiserver to apply changes.

    ```yaml
    sudo systemctl restart kube-apiserver
    ```

Create an admission config file to specify registry policies and link it in the kube-apiserver configuration:

```yaml
# Image Policy Webhook config
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: ImagePolicyWebhook
    configuration:
      imagePolicy:
        kubeConfigFile: /path/to/config/file
        defaultAllow: true
```
