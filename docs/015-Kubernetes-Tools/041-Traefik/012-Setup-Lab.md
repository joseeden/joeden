## Overview 

This guide outlines the steps to prepare your environment for the Traefik labs.

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 

If you're using **Windows**, make sure to switch Docker to use **Linux containers** after installation. This is required for compatibility with the labs. See 

## Use Browser-Based Docker (Optional)

If Docker doesn’t work on your machine, try the web-based option:

- Visit [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)
- It lets you run Docker in your browser
- You can still follow the labs, although with some limitations

This option is a good backup when local setup isn’t possible.
