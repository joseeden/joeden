## Overview

Observability helps us understand what is happening with our Traefik and services using logs, metrics, monitoring, and tracing.

- Logs show detailed information about Traefik events.
- Access logs record who accessed the services and when.
- Metrics collect data on performance and system health.
- Tracing follows the path of requests through the system to help troubleshoot.

These tools give us insight into how our systems work and help us find and fix problems.

## Logging Traefik

Logging helps us track events and diagnose issues clearly.

- Enable Traefik logs to see what is happening in detail.
- Adjust log levels to control how much information is stored.
- Store logs in specific paths for easy access.


## Access Logs

Access logs give a clear picture of user activity on services.

- Record who is accessing each service.
- Show IP addresses and services accessed.
- Work like standard web access logs.

## Monitoring and Metrics

Metrics help us keep the system running smoothly by spotting issues early.

- Collect data about system health and Traefik performance.
- Use tools like Prometheus to monitor metrics.
- Watch for problems like slow responses or service failures.


## Tracing Requests

Tracing reveals how requests move through the system.

- Follow the flow of requests from Traefik to services.
- Understand where delays or errors occur.
- Make troubleshooting faster and more effective.


## Planning for Observability

Good observability lets us be prepared and respond quickly.

- Think of operations as a software problem to solve.
- Use logging, access logs, metrics, and tracing together.
- Plan ahead to avoid relying on luck when problems happen.


## Using Alerts and Tickets

This system helps teams react properly and manage issues efficiently.

- Alerts tell us when immediate action is needed.
- Tickets track less urgent issues to handle later.
- Logs support diagnosing problems after they happen.


## Operational Models 

We want to find a balance between reacting to issues and preventing them before they happen.

- Collect useful metrics regularly
- Set up observability between Traefik and applications
- Get detailed, clear insights into system behavior

This approach helps us respond quickly while also improving overall system health.

## User Perspective

Users mainly want the system to work well and be dependable for them.

- Users care **if the system is available** to them
- **Monitor the availability** and health of services
- **Measure latency** to check how fast services respond
- **Keep reliability high** to maintain user trust
