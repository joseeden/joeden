## Overview

The Traefik API gives you access to Traefikâ€™s configuration and status. It is enabled by default in the static Traefik configuration but is often underused.

- Can be accessed through a URL like `traefik.localhost/api`
- Provides data about routers, services, middlewares, and more
- Full API paths are needed to get proper results (e.g., `/api/http/routers`)
- Lets you monitor and manage Traefik programmatically.

## Security Considerations

The Traefik API exposes critical configuration details, so it should be used carefully.

- Best used only in **development** or **test** environments
- If enabled in production, always secure with authorization middleware
- Restrict access by IP to trusted networks only

If the Traefik API is enabled in production, make sure you it secure with authorization middleware.

## Traefik API Endpoints

The Traefik API lets you view and manage your Traefik setup through various endpoints. These endpoints provide information about routers, services, middlewares, and more.

| Endpoint                | Description            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `/api/http/routers`     | List all HTTP routers  |
| `/api/http/services`    | Show all HTTP services |
| `/api/http/middlewares` | Display middlewares    |
| `/api/tcp/routers`      | List TCP routers       |
| `/api/tcp/services`     | Show TCP services      |
| `/api/udp/routers`      | List UDP routers       |
| `/api/udp/services`     | Show UDP services      |

You can access these endpoints via HTTP requests. For example, to get all HTTP routers:

```bash
curl http://traefik.localhost/api/http/routers
```

This will return a JSON response with details about your HTTP routers.



## Lab: Viewing APIs 


```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/http/routers | jq 
```

It will return:

```bash

```

To see the services..

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/http/services | jq 
```

Output:

```bash
  
```
