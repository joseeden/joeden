##  Overview

This lab focuses on managing Traefik health checks, securing the dashboard and API, and enabling TLS with DNS challenge certificates.

- Enable CLI-based health check
- Enable ping health endpoint
- Secure dashboard and API with TLS
- Deploy on a cloud platform with DNS challenge for certificates

These steps ensure Traefik is monitored, secure, and ready for production traffic.

## Pre-requisites 

### Setup a Public Cloud VM 

It is recommended to perform this lab on a a VM with a public IP because you need to open port 80 to the internet.

- DNS must point to the VM’s public IP
- Let’s Encrypt can verify via HTTP without issues

If you do this lab in a local Windows machine with a private LAN IP (`192.168.x.x`), you can open firewall ports 80 and 443. However, this won’t work if your router or network blocks or doesn’t forward that traffic.

You can create a public VM on:

- [Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
- [Azure Virtual Machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal)
- [GCP Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)
- [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/)
- [Linode Instance](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/create-a-linode/)

Make sure your EC2 security group allows inbound TCP traffic on:

- Port 80 (HTTP)
- Port 443 (HTTPS)
- Port 8080 (Traefik dashboard)

After launching your VM, install the necessary tools.

```bash
# Install Git 
sudo yum update -y && sudo yum install -y git

# Install Docker 
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable docker
sudo yum install -y docker

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl enable --now docker && sudo systemctl status docker

# Configure Docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user && newgrp docker

# Install Docker compsoe
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Configure permission
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && docker-compose --version

# Initialize Docker Swarm (needed for docker stack deploy):
docker swarm init
```

### Prepare your Domain 

Before enabling HTTPS in Traefik:

- Have a domain name ready
- Set DNS records with a supported DNS provider
- See [Traefik DNS Providers](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.3/https/acme/#providers)

For example, my setup uses:

- Domain from Namecheap
- DNS hosted on DigitalOcean

After getting a domain, update its registrar settings so it points to your chosen DNS provider. If you're also using DigitalOcean, you can follow the steps here: [Adding a Domain in DigitalOcean](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/020-Homelab/040-DigitalOcean.md#adding-a-domain)

**NOTE:** Make sure your domain is fully set up and pointing to your server before proceeding with the labs. Propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, sometimes longer depending on the registrar and TLD.

To verify, you can run:

```bash
dig NS yourdomain.com
dig A yourdomain.com
```

Example output for DigitalOcean:

```bash
yourdomain.com. 1800 IN NS ns1.digitalocean.com.
yourdomain.com. 1800 IN NS ns2.digitalocean.com.
yourdomain.com. 1800 IN NS ns3.digitalocean.com.
yourdomain.com. 300  IN A  192.0.2.123
```


### Set Up DNS Records

Once you've changed your domain’s nameservers to your DNS provider, the next step is to add your DNS records there. 

Here are the DNS records I used. You can copy them but make sure to replace with your own domain details.

| Type | Hostname                | Value                   | TTL (seconds) |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| A    | `*.joeden.site`         | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |
| A    | `www.joeden.site`       | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |
| A    | `dashboard.joeden.site` | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |
| A    | `joeden.site`           | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |

The IP `34.201.50.100` is my test machine's public IP. Point the DNS records to your machine's public IP.

The `dashboard.joeden.site` is used to access the Traefik dashboard.

You can also use shorthand names since they mean the same:

| Type | Hostname        | Value                   | TTL (seconds) |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| A    | `*.joeden.site` | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |
| A    | `www`           | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |
| A    | `dashboard`     | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |
| A    | `@`             | points to 34.201.50.100 | 30            |

If you set this up in DigitalOcean, your DNS records should look like this:

| Type | Hostname                | Value                          | TTL (seconds) |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| NS   | `joeden.site`           | points to ns1.digitalocean.com | 30            |
| NS   | `joeden.site`           | points to ns2.digitalocean.com | 30            |
| NS   | `joeden.site`           | points to ns3.digitalocean.com | 30            |
| A    | `*.joeden.site`         | points to 34.201.50.100        | 30            |
| A    | `www.joeden.site`       | points to 34.201.50.100        | 30            |
| A    | `dashboard.joeden.site` | points to 34.201.50.100        | 30            |
| A    | `joeden.site`           | points to 34.201.50.100        | 30            |


### Clone the Repository 

> Github repo: [joseeden/labs-traefik](https://github.com/joseeden/labs-traefik/tree/master)

Login to the public cloud VM and clone the project repository from GitHub. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joseeden/labs-traefik.git
cd labs-traefik/07-operations/02-health-checks
```

Project structure:

```bash

└── 02-health-checks
    ├── .env
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── docker-compose.cli.yml
    ├── traefik.dns.yml

        └── test
```





## Create an API Token 

To allow Traefik to update DNS records automatically, you’ll need a token from your DNS provider. In my setup, I'm using DigitalOcean as my DNS provider.

1. Go to your DNS provider’s dashboard (e.g., DigitalOcean)
2. Generate a new API token with DNS access
3. Copy the token. This will be added to the Docker compose

This token is used by Traefik to prove domain ownership via the DNS challenge.

:::info 

To generate the token in DigitalOcean please see [Generate an API Token.](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/020-Homelab/040-DigitalOcean.md#generate-personal-access-token)

:::


## Create the `.env` file

Once you have the API token, create a `.env`:

```bash title=".env"
DO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_real_token_here
```

## Creating Passwords

This lab uses basic authentication, so user passwords must be securely stored as hashes in a users file.

To create hashed passwords, install the `htpasswd` tool:

```bash
sudo apt install -y apache2-utils
```

Here are example user credentials. You can change them as needed:

| Username  | Password              |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| johnsmith | `Thr3@tl3u3lw!dN!QHt` |
| janedoe   | `@Ll!$szM3lLiND@h0oD` |

Generate a hash with this command:

```bash
htpasswd -nb johnsmith 'Thr3@tl3u3lw!dN!QHt'
```

The output will look similar to:

```
johnsmith:$apr1$cipim6NJ$LK11Xtf0t92UvxjKCV8ii0
```

Repeat this for each user.

Next, create a file called `usersfile` in the same directory as your Docker Compose file. Add all hashed credentials here, one per line:

```bash title="usersfile"
johnsmith:$apr1$cipim6NJ$LK11Xtf0t92UvxjKCV8ii0
janedoe:$apr1$t65c7tuF$Qscp40RYl.Tq02pUnSv5r1
```

Finally, add `usersfile` to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control:

```bash 
echo "usersfile" >> .gitignore
```


## Deploy the Files 

First, load your environment variables from the `.env` file:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

Then deploy the Traefik stack:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.cli.yml traefik
```

Output:

```bash
Creating network traefik_default
Creating service traefik_traefik
Creating service traefik_catapp
Creating service traefik_error 
```

After deployment, the dashboard and API run securely with TLS enabled, and health checks monitor container status.

Check the Traefik service logs to confirm the TLS certificate was issued successfully:

```bash
docker service logs traefik_traefik
```

Look for messages about the DNS challenge and certificate issuance.

```bash
output... 
```


## Access the Dashboard 

Open the dashboard and, when asked, enter the username and password you created in the `usersfile`.

```bash
https://yourdomain.com/dashboard/
```

<!-- insert photo here -->


Click the lock icon near the URL to verify the connection is secure. The certificate details should show that Let’s Encrypt issued it.

<!-- insert photo here -->


:::info 

With **secure mode** enabled, only authenticated users over HTTPS can access the dashboard and API.

:::


## Access the API 

You can also query the Traefik API to check services, for example:

```bash
https://yourdomain.com/api/http/services
```

You can also query the Traefik API to check services, for example:

## Check Health Status

To see the status of your containers, run this command from the terminal:

```bash
docker ps 
```

You’ll see container statuses in the `STATUS` column. The Traefik container should show as `Healthy` because health checks are enabled.

```bash
add sample output.. 
```

To test this, remove and redeploy the stack:

```bash
docker stack rm traefik 
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.cli.yml traefik
```

Then quickly check container status:

```bash
watch docker ps 
```

You will see the health status change as containers start and become healthy.


<!-- insert gif showing the watch -->




## Ping Endpoint

You can check the Traefik ping endpoint with:

```bash
http://yourdomain.com:8080/ping
```

Expected output:

```
OK
```

**Note:** The ping endpoint uses HTTP (not HTTPS) because some monitoring tools may not support HTTPS. You can configure it to use HTTPS if needed.

## Cleanup

Remove the deployed stack:

```bash
docker stack rm traefik 
```

Delete your `.env` file:

```bash
rm -f .env 
```

Go to your DNS provider and delete the API token.
