## Overview 

From the official [Hashicorp documentation:](https://www.terraform.io/docs)

> Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes both low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

Terraform can be used to:

- Provision on-prem resources
- Provision multi-cloud deployments
- Has open-source but also has *Terraform Cloud*
- Codify infra into machine-readable executable documentation
- Repeatable infra builds
- Manage and maintain infra configuration drift
- Version-controll through git
- Integrate with CICD systems

## Install Terraform

To use Terraform, it needs to be installed on your machine.

See: [Install Terraform.](/docs/001-Personal-Notes/050-Project-Pre-requisites/015-Terraform.md)

## Workspaces

We can utilize **workspaces** to manage separate environments using the same set of configuration files.

```bash
terraform workspace 
```

To create a new workspace,

```bash
terraform workpace  new  <name> 
```

To select a workspace,

```bash
terraform workspace select <name>
```

## Root Module

This is a directory on the local filesystem containing all the configuration files and code files. This is typically consists of three files:

- `main.tf`
- `variables.tf`
- `outputs.tf`
- `provider.tf`

This root directory may also contain:

- `terraform.state`
- `terraform.state.backup`

## Providers 

Terraform uses **providers** to interact with various cloud platforms and services. Some popular providers include:

- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Kubernetes

For more information, please see [Providers](/docs/017-Infrastructure-as-Code/010-Terraform/011-Providers.md)

## Using Terraform with Git

Terraform configurations are often stored in Git for version control. Some files should **never** be committed because they contain local state or downloaded dependencies.

These files can be added to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. Sample `.gitignore`:

```bash title="gitignore"
.terraform*
.terraform.tfstate*
*.tfstate.*
*.tfstate
.terraform.lock.hcl
linux_386
linux_amd64
```

## Authentication

Before writing Terraform code, you need to make sure authentication with API keys is set up. Terraform reads credentials in the order specified below:

1. API keys can be hardcoded in `main.tf` (not recommended)
2. Environment variables to store keys securely
3. `shared_credentials_file` for local credentials

## Terraform CLI

See: [Hashicorp documentation.](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands)

Here is a summarized cheatsheet.

## Provisioning Workflow

The typical workflow when using Terraform involves the following commands:

- `terraform init`
- `terraform validate`
- `terraform plan `
- `terraform apply`
- `terraform destroy`

## Terraform HCL Language

Terraform uses the **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** to define and manage infrastructure. 

- Defines the basic structure and grammar of Terraform code
- JSON syntax is available for systems that donâ€™t use HCL directly
- Style conventions ensure consistent formatting across files

You can automatically apply formatting standards using `terraform fmt`.

Comments can be added using the `#` symbol:

```
# This is a comment
```

For multi-line comments, use `/* */`:

```
/* This is
a comment
spanning multiple lines
*/
```

Strings can be defined in different ways depending on their length and purpose:

```
"This is a single-line string"
```

For multi-line strings, use the `EOF` marker:

```
<<EOF
This message
is composed of
multiple lines.
EOF
```

For more details, refer to the official [Terraform syntax documentation](https://www.terraform.io/language/syntax/configuration).
