## Overview

Apache Tomcat can serve as an effective staging environment for testing applications before production. By deploying to Tomcat, teams can evaluate application functionality in a controlled setting, ensuring it meets quality standards before full release. 

- Supports testing with similar configurations as the production environment.
- Allows for validation of deployment processes and troubleshooting.
- Enables integration testing with other services in a near-production setting.

## Lab Environment

In this lab, we have the following machines, and we will use a local computer (laptop) to connect to them.

- jenkinsmaster

You can choose to set up a virtual machine on your computer or create instances in the cloud. In this case, EC2 instances are used.

Note that for this lab, we'll only be using **jenkinsmaster** and you can disregard the other **tstsvrs** and **jenkinsslave1** for now.

## Install Tomcat using Ansible
 
For labbing purpose, we'll just install the Tomcat in the same Jenkins server. Currently, our Jenkins server is on a RHEL 8 Machine. Following this links:

- [How to Install Apache Tomcat in RHEL 8](https://www.tecmint.com/install-apache-tomcat-in-rhel-8/)
- [Install Apache Tomcat 9 on CentOS 8 / RHEL 8](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-apache-tomcat-9-on-linux-rhel-centos/)

Note that Java must first be installed. To check:

```bash
$ java --version

openjdk 11.0.14 2022-01-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.14+9-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.14+9-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Once done, install tomcat on the Jenkins server. We have an option to follow the steps from the two links above but since I wanted to make sure I can re-run this lab multiple times without the need to input any commands, I created an Ansible playbook

```yaml title="install-tomcat.yml"
