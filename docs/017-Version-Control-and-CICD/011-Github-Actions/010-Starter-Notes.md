## Overview

GitHub Actions (GHA) automates software workflows like building, testing, and deploying code.  

- Built-in CI/CD system in GitHub  
- Automates repetitive development tasks  
- Runs directly inside GitHub repositories  

Just like a car assembly line has workers performing tasks step by step, GHA automates software development in an organized flow.  

## GHA Components

### Event  

An event is what triggers a workflow in GitHub Actions.  

- Happens when someone pushes code, opens a pull request, or creates an issue  
- Can also be triggered manually or on a schedule  

```yaml
on: push  # Triggers workflow when code is pushed
```

### Workflow  

A workflow is a set of automated tasks defined in a YAML file.  

- Stored in `.github/workflows/`  
- Can contain multiple jobs  
- Runs when triggered by an event  

Example: A workflow to test and deploy code:  

```yaml
name: CI Workflow
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "Running tests"
```

### Steps and Actions  

A step is an individual task within a job. An action is a reusable task inside a step.  

- Steps execute in order within a job  
- Actions simplify complex tasks (e.g., checking out code)  

Example: Running a script after checking out code:  

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Action to get the code
  - run: python script.py       # Step to run the script
```

### Jobs and Runners  

A job is a collection of steps, and a runner is the machine that executes them.  

- Jobs run independently, but dependencies can be set  
- Runners can be Linux, macOS, or Windows  

Example: Two jobs running in parallel:  

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building the app"
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Testing the app"
```

## A Simple GHA Workflow  

A push event triggers a workflow with a job that runs on Ubuntu.  

- Step 1: Checkout repository  
- Step 2: Run a Python script  

Example:  

```yaml
name: Simple Workflow
on: push
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: python script.py
```

## Putting It All Together  

A GitHub Actions workflow consists of:  

1. **Events** (trigger the workflow)  
2. **Workflows** (contain jobs)  
3. **Jobs** (contain steps)  
4. **Steps** (run scripts or actions)  
5. **Runners** (execute jobs)  

An example flow:  

- A push triggers a workflow  
- The workflow runs jobs in parallel  
- Jobs contain steps like scripts or actions  
- Outputs (artifacts) can be generated if needed
