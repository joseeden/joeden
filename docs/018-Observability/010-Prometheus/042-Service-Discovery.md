## Overview

Service discovery in Prometheus helps automatically find and track targets for monitoring. It simplifies the management of dynamic environments where services may frequently change.

- Prometheus discovers services using DNS, file, or cloud APIs.
- Targets are automatically updated when services change.
- Service discovery handles dynamic environments.
- It eliminates manual target configuration.

Prometheus has built-in support for several service discovery mechanisms:

## Static Config 

Static configuration is used to define fixed targets for scraping metrics. This is useful when the target services don't change frequently.

```yaml title="prometheus.yml"
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100', 'server2:9100', 'server3:9100']
  
  - job_name: 'api-service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
  
  - job_name: 'web-service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:80', 'webserver2:80']
```

## File Service Discovery

File-based service discovery allows the configuration of target endpoints from an external file. This is still considered static since the targets need to be defined in a separate configuration file. 

Reference the targets file in the `prometheus.yml` file. You can specify the file or use globbing to reference the target files ending in YAML or JSON.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node-exporter'
    file_sd_configs:
      - files:
        - 'targets.json'
        - '*.json' 
```

The file containing the targets can either be in JSON or YAML.

Example `targets.json` file:

```yaml
[
  {
    "targets": ["localhost:9100", "server2:9100"],
    "labels": {
      "job": "node-exporter"
    }
  },
  {
    "targets": ["api-server:8080"],
    "labels": {
      "job": "api-service"
    }
  }
]
```

## EC2 Service Discovery 

EC2 service discovery allows Prometheus to automatically discover targets from AWS EC2 instances. This is useful for monitoring dynamic EC2 environments where instances can be added or removed.

Ensure that you have set up the credentials for the IAM user with the correct permissions, specifically the `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` policy.

Example `prometheus.yml` file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'ec2-instances'
    ec2_sd_configs:
      - region: <region>
        access_key: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
        secret_key: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_instance_id]
        target_label: instance
      - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_tag_Name]
        target_label: instance_name
```

The `instance` label defaults to using the private IP, as it is assumed that the Prometheus server is running within the same environment as the EC2 instances. However, if the Prometheus server is outside the environment and can only communicate with the EC2 instances via public IP, you can use the metadata to map the public IP to the `instance` label.

Hereâ€™s how to configure it in the `prometheus.yml` file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'ec2-instances'
    ec2_sd_configs:
      - region: us-west-2
        access_key: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
        secret_key: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_instance_id]
        target_label: instance
      - source_labels: [__meta_ec2_public_ip]
        target_label: instance_ip
``` 

This will map the public IP of the EC2 instances to the `instance_ip` label when the Prometheus server is outside the EC2 environment.


## Re-labelling 

Re-labeling in Prometheus allows you to modify or create new labels for metrics based on existing ones. This is useful for grouping, filtering, or enriching metrics during collection.

For example, we have the following nodes with labels:

| **Node** | **Instance**           | **Region**            |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| node1    | instance="node1:9100"  | region="ap-southeast-1" |
| node2    | instance="node2:9100"  | region="ap-southeast-1" |

We can use re-labelling to:

1. Drop the `region` label and rename the `instance` label, so that:

    | **Node** | **Instance**           |
    |----------|------------------------|
    | node1    | instance="node1"       |
    | node2    | instance="node2"       |

2. Grab the `http_errors_total` metric after the scrape and rename it to `http_failures_total`.

You can configure re-labeling in the `scrape_configs` section of the `prometheus.yml` file.

- `relabel_configs`: Relabelling is done before a scrape and only has access to labels from Service Discovery.
- `metric_relabel_configs`: Relabelling is done after the scrape and has access to all metrics and labels.

Here's a sample `prometheus.yml` file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'example-job'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node1:9100', 'node2:9100']
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [region]
        action: labeldrop
      - source_labels: [instance]
        target_label: instance
        action: replace
        replacement: '${1}'
    metric_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__name__]              
        target_label: __name__                 
        regex: 'http_errors_total'                 
        action: replace 
        replacement: 'http_failures_total'  
```
