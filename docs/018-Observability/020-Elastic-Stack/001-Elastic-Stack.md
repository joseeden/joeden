## Overview 

The Elastic Stack is a collection of open-source tools for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data in real time. It includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats to handle various data processing needs.  

- **Elasticsearch**  
  - A highly scalable distributed search and analytics engine.  
  - Stores and retrieves data quickly.  
  - Supports full-text search, geospatial data, and machine learning features.  

- **Logstash**  
  - A versatile data processing pipeline.  
  - Collects, enriches, and transforms data from multiple sources.  

- **Kibana**  
  - A visualization and monitoring tool for Elasticsearch data.  
  - Builds interactive dashboards and custom visualizations.  
  - Includes alerting and machine learning features.  

In recent years, Elastic has shifted focus to direct integrations, reducing dependency on Logstash.  

- **Beats**  
  - Lightweight data shippers for specific use cases.  
  - Filebeat handles log file collection, while Metricbeat gathers system metrics.  
  - Variants: Heartbeat (for uptime monitoring) and Packetbeat (for network data).  

- **Fluent**  
  - A newer, versatile log collection and processing tool.  
  - Optimized for high-performance data pipelines.  
  - Often used as an alternative to Logstash in modern deployments.  
  - Integrates with various outputs, including Elasticsearch and cloud platforms.  

## Centralized Logging  

Centralized logging consolidates logs for quick issue detection and resolution. It combines powerful search and visualization features for efficient troubleshooting.  

  - Elastic Stack supports large-scale data handling.  
  - Ideal for system monitoring and troubleshooting.  
  - Suitable for indexing and searching diverse datasets

With Kibana, we can enable filtering, complex queries, and data visualization.  

  - Search for keywords like "error" to pinpoint issues.  
  - Visualize patterns and spikes for faster insights.
