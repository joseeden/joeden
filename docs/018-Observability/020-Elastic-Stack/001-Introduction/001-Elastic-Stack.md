## Overview 

The Elastic Stack is a collection of open-source tools for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data in real time. It includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats to handle various data processing needs.  

- **Elasticsearch**  
  - A highly scalable distributed search and analytics engine.  
  - Stores and retrieves data quickly.  
  - Supports full-text search, geospatial data, and machine learning features.  

- **Logstash**  
  - A versatile data processing pipeline.  
  - Collects, enriches, and transforms data from multiple sources.  

- **Kibana**  
  - A visualization and monitoring tool for Elasticsearch data.  
  - Builds interactive dashboards and custom visualizations.  
  - Includes alerting and machine learning features.  

In recent years, Elastic has shifted focus to direct integrations, reducing dependency on Logstash.  

- **Beats**  
  - Lightweight data shippers for specific use cases.  
  - Filebeat handles log file collection, while Metricbeat gathers system metrics.  
  - Variants: Heartbeat (for uptime monitoring) and Packetbeat (for network data).  

- **Fluent**  
  - A newer, versatile log collection and processing tool.  
  - Optimized for high-performance data pipelines.  
  - Often used as an alternative to Logstash in modern deployments.  

## Centralized Logging  

Centralized logging consolidates logs for quick issue detection and resolution. It combines powerful search and visualization features for efficient troubleshooting.  

  - Elastic Stack supports large-scale data handling.  
  - Ideal for system monitoring and troubleshooting.  
  - Suitable for indexing and searching diverse datasets

With Kibana, we can enable filtering, complex queries, and data visualization.  

  - Search for keywords like "error" to pinpoint issues.  
  - Visualize patterns and spikes for faster insights.  

## Elastic Agent 

Elastic Stack provides powerful tools for collecting, processing, storing, and analyzing data. Modern setups often use **Elastic Agent** for data ingestion, with Beats or Logstash as complementary tools.  

- **Elastic Agent**:  
  - Simplifies data ingestion and acts as a wrapper around Beats.  
  - Provides an integrated method to ship data to Elasticsearch.  

- **Beats**:  
  - Lightweight tools focused on specific data types.
  - Filebeat for log files, Metricbeat for metrics.
  - Includes official Elastic-maintained Beats and community-developed options.  

While Elastic has moved away from requiring **Logstash**, it remains useful for advanced data transformations.  

  - Converts plain text logs into structured data objects for Elasticsearch.  
  - Resource-intensive but capable of processing complex transformations.  

## Elasticsearch Clustering

Elasticsearch uses clusters to distribute data across shards for redundancy and scalability.  

  - It stores and indexes data and makes it searchable.  
  - Enables efficient storage and retrieval, even in degraded states.  

## Kibana as Frontend

Kibana serves as the Elastic Stack's front end and enables interaction with data.  

  - Supports ad hoc searches, visualizations, and dashboards.  
  - Includes features for observability and security (some require paid versions).  

In recent updates, Kibana has evolved into a central UI for managing and configuring the Elastic Stack, streamlining operations.
