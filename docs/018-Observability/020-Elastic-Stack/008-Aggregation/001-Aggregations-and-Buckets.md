## Overview

Elasticsearch is not just a search engineâ€”it can analyze and structure numerical data, providing quick and efficient metrics analysis.

Elasticsearch aggregations can sometimes replace tools like Hadoop and Spark. While Hadoop or Spark might take minutes or hours to process queries, Elasticsearch often delivers results in seconds.  


## Aggregation Types 

### Bucket Aggregation  

Bucket aggregation groups documents into buckets based on specific criteria, similar to the SQL `GROUP BY` clause. These buckets can be defined by terms, ranges, or intervals, such as grouping by sector or creating date histograms.  

- Groups documents into buckets based on matching criteria  
- Options include single terms, ranges, or date histograms  
- Allows splitting data into meaningful categories  

While powerful, too many buckets can overwhelm the coordinating node responsible for reducing results. To mitigate this, limit the number of buckets per shard or consider partitioning to balance performance and accuracy.  

The image below illustrates the problem with generating too many buckets:

### Metric Aggregation  

Metric aggregation calculates values for specific fields, either within buckets or across all documents. These values include predefined metrics like maximum, minimum, and average, or custom calculations using scripts.  

- Calculates values like max, min, or average for fields  
- Can be applied to specific buckets or all data  
- Supports custom scripts for advanced calculations  

Metric aggregation helps analyze and summarize data efficiently, providing insights into patterns and trends.  

### Pipeline Aggregation  

Pipeline aggregation processes and calculates metrics based on the output of other aggregations. These can be used to further refine or transform data, such as calculating cumulative sums or moving averages.  

- Works on the results of other aggregations  
- Useful for advanced calculations like cumulative sums or moving averages  
- Enhances insights by refining existing aggregation results  

Pipeline aggregation enables complex analysis by chaining and transforming results from other operations.  

## Aggregation Syntax

The basic aggregation syntax is:  

```json  
"aggs": {  
  "name_of_aggregation": {  
    "type_of_aggregation": {  
      "field": "document_field_name"  
    }  
  }  
}  
```  

Where: 

- **aggs**: Specifies that an aggregation is being used.  
- **name_of_aggregation**: User-defined name for the aggregation.  
- **type_of_aggregation**: The aggregation type (e.g., terms, sum).  
- **field**: Indicates the target field.  
- **document_field_name**: The column name of the document to aggregate.
