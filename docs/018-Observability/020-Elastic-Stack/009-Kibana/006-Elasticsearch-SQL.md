## Overview

Elasticsearch SQL lets you query data in Elasticsearch using SQL syntax. You can run queries from the Elastic Cloud console or directly via the terminal.  

If you're using Elastic Cloud, go to **Management > DevTools**, enter your SQL commands in the Console Editor, and click the **Play** button to see results.  

![](/img/docs/01302025-elastic-cloud-elasticsearch-sql.png)  

If you are using a self-managed Elasticsearch cluster, you can run SQL queries from the terminal using `curl`:  

```bash
curl -XPOST https://add-your-endpoint-here/_xpack/sql?format=txt -d '
{
  "query": "DESCRIBE index-name-here" 
}' 
```  

## How it Works  

Elasticsearch SQL processes queries in several steps:  

1. **Parser**: Converts the SQL query into an internal abstract syntax tree (AST) and validates it.  
2. **Analyzer**: Matches tables, columns, and functions to the underlying indices and creates a logical execution plan.  
3. **Query Planner**: Optimizes the logical plan by removing redundant operations and generates a physical plan.  
4. **Query Executor**: Runs the physical plan to execute the query. Returns the query results to the client.  

Hereâ€™s a diagram illustrating the Elasticsearch SQL query execution process:

## Lab Environment 

| Node    | Hostname       | IP Address       | 
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Node 1  | elasticsearch  |  192.168.56.101  |

Setup details:

- The node is created in VirtualBox using Vagrant.
- An SSH key is generated on the Elasticsearch node
- The Logstash node can reach Elasticsearch node via port 9200 
- The Logstash node needs to have internet access for this lab.

## Pre-requisites 

You can run a virtual machine in VirtualBox or use cloud-based compute instances. 

- [Create the nodes in VirtualBox](/docs/018-Observability/020-Elastic-Stack/002-Setting-up/001-Using-Vagrant-and-VirtualBox.md#setup-the-virtual-machines)
- [Install Elasticsearch on node 1](/docs/018-Observability/020-Elastic-Stack/002-Setting-up/001-Using-Vagrant-and-VirtualBox.md#install-elasticsearch-817)
- [Configure SSL on Elasticsearch](/docs/018-Observability/020-Elastic-Stack/002-Setting-up/003-SSL-Configuration.md)
- [Install jq](https://www.scaler.com/topics/linux-jq/)


## Verify Connection

First, define your Elasticsearch endpoint and credentials:  

```bash
ELASTIC_ENDPOINT="https://your-elasticsearch-endpoint:9200"
ELASTIC_USER="your-username"
ELASTIC_PW="your-password"
```  

If running these commands on an Elasticsearch node, set the endpoint to `https://127.0.0.1`.  

Run the following command to check connectivity:  

```bash
curl -s -u $ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW \
-XGET $ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200
```  

Expected output:  

```json
{
  "name" : "node1",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "UYlLyPlmRkGGSHGZQxUIhw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.17.0",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "2b6a7fed44faa321997703718f07ee0420804b41",
    "build_date" : "2024-12-11T12:08:05.663969764Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.12.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
} 
```  

## Import the Dataset  

Download the dataset here: [movies.json](@site/assets/elastic-stack/movies-2.json)  

Run the command below to create the `movies` index and import the dataset.

```bash
curl -s -u $ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-XPUT $ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_bulk?pretty  \
--data-binary @movies-2.json 
```  

Verify the index.

```bash
curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
-XGET $ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_cat/indices?v 
```

## Using Self-Hosted Elasticsearch

To interact with Elasticsearch and run SQL-like queries, you can use the following cURL commands.

Example: Use this command to describe the `movies` index:

```bash
curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_sql" -d '
{
  "query": "DESCRIBE movies"
}' | jq
```

:::info 

Elasticsearch 7.0 and later replaced `_xpack/sq`l with `_sql`:

:::

Alternatively, you can try:

```bash
curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_sql" -d '
{
  "query": "DESCRIBE movies"
}' | jq
```

Output:

```bash
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "column",
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    {
      "name": "type",
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    {
      "name": "mapping",
      "type": "keyword"
    }
  ],
  "rows": [
    [
      "genre",
      "VARCHAR",
      "text"
    ],
    [
      "genre.keyword",
      "VARCHAR",
      "keyword"
    ],
    [
      "id",
      "VARCHAR",
      "text"
    ],
    [
      "id.keyword",
      "VARCHAR",
      "keyword"
    ],
    [
      "title",
      "VARCHAR",
      "text"
    ],
    [
      "title.keyword",
      "VARCHAR",
      "keyword"
    ],
    [
      "year",
      "BIGINT",
      "long"
    ]
  ]
} 
```

You can also format the results for better readability:

```bash
curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_sql?format=txt" -d '
{
  "query": "DESCRIBE movies"
}' 
```

This will display the results in a table format, similar to SQL:

```bash
    column     |     type      |    mapping
---------------+---------------+---------------
genre          |VARCHAR        |text
genre.keyword  |VARCHAR        |keyword
id             |VARCHAR        |text
id.keyword     |VARCHAR        |keyword
title          |VARCHAR        |text
title.keyword  |VARCHAR        |keyword
year           |BIGINT         |long 
```


#### Other Example Queries

- To get the first 10 movie titles from the `movies` index.

    ```bash
    curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_sql?format=txt" -d '
    {
      "query": "SELECT title FROM movies LIMIT 10"
    }' 
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
              title
    ---------------------------
    Toy Story
    Jumanji
    Grumpier Old Men
    Waiting to Exhale
    Father of the Bride Part II
    Heat
    Sabrina
    Tom and Huck
    Sudden Death
    GoldenEye 
    ```

- To retrieve the title and year for movies released before 1920, sorted by release year:

    ```bash
    curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_sql?format=txt" -d '
    {
      "query": "SELECT title, year FROM movies WHERE year < 1920 ORDER BY year"
    }' 
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
                        title                      |     year
    ------------------------------------------------+---------------
    Trip to the Moon, A                             |1902
    The Great Train Robbery                         |1903
    The Electric Hotel                              |1908
    Birth of a Nation, The                          |1915
    Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages|1916
    20,000 Leagues Under the Sea                    |1916
    Snow White                                      |1916
    Rink, The                                       |1916
    Immigrant, The                                  |1917
    Daddy Long Legs                                 |1919 
    ```

## Using Elastic Cloud 

You can also run SQL commands on indexes in Elastic Cloud.
Same as before, set your variables first in a new terminal:

```bash
ELASTIC_ENDPOINT="https://your-elasticsearch-endpoint"
ELASTIC_USER="your-username"
ELASTIC_PW="your-password"
```

Next, ensure the movie dataset is imported:

```bash
curl -s -u $ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-XPUT $ELASTIC_ENDPOINT/_bulk?pretty  \
--data-binary @movies-2.json 
```

You can run the same SQL statements:

- To describe the `movies` index:

    ```bash
    curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT/_sql?format=txt" -d '
    {
      "query": "DESCRIBE movies"
    }'
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
        column     |     type      |    mapping    
    ---------------+---------------+---------------
    genre          |VARCHAR        |text
    genre.keyword  |VARCHAR        |keyword
    id             |VARCHAR        |text
    id.keyword     |VARCHAR        |keyword
    title          |VARCHAR        |text
    title.keyword  |VARCHAR        |keyword
    year           |BIGINT         |long 
    ```

- To get the first 10 movie titles in the `movies` index:

    ```bash
    curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200/_sql?format=txt" -d '
    {
      "query": "SELECT title FROM movies LIMIT 10"
    }' 
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
              title
    ---------------------------
    Toy Story
    Jumanji
    Grumpier Old Men
    Waiting to Exhale
    Father of the Bride Part II
    Heat
    Sabrina
    Tom and Huck
    Sudden Death
    GoldenEye 
    ```

- To get the title and year of movies released before 1920, sorted by release year:

    ```bash
    curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT/_sql?format=txt" -d '
    {
      "query": "SELECT title, year FROM movies WHERE year < 1920 ORDER BY year"
    }' 
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
                        title                      |     year
    ------------------------------------------------+---------------
    Trip to the Moon, A                             |1902
    The Great Train Robbery                         |1903
    The Electric Hotel                              |1908
    Birth of a Nation, The                          |1915
    Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages|1916

    Snow White                                      |1916
    Rink, The                                       |1916
    Immigrant, The                                  |1917
    Daddy Long Legs                                 |1919 
    ```


## Translate SQL to DSL 

To view the DSL (the underlying JSON query), use this command. It works on both self-hosted Elasticsearch clusters and Elastic Cloud deployments. Just ensure you're using the correct endpoint URL.

```bash
curl -s -u "$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -XPOST "$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT/_sql/translate?pretty" -d '
  {
    "query": "SELECT title, year FROM movies WHERE year < 1920 ORDER BY year"
  }'
```

Output:

```json
{
  "size" : 1000,
  "query" : {
    "range" : {
      "year" : {
        "lt" : 1920,
        "boost" : 1.0
      }
    }
  },
  "_source" : false,
  "fields" : [
    {
      "field" : "title"
    },
    {
      "field" : "year"
    }
  ],
  "sort" : [
    {
      "year" : {
        "order" : "asc",
        "missing" : "_last",
        "unmapped_type" : "long"
      }
    }
  ],
  "track_total_hits" : -1
} 
```

## Using the SQL Client 

You can use the standalone SQL client for running SQL queries, which is similar to querying a database. However, note that this is only available on self-hosted Elasticsearch clusters, as you need access to the executable.

Same as before, set your variables first in a new terminal:

```bash
ELASTIC_ENDPOINT="https://your-elasticsearch-endpoint"
ELASTIC_USER="your-username"
ELASTIC_PW="your-password"
```

To run the SQL client:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-sql-cli
```

If you're using HTTPS with a username and password, use this command. Provide the keystore password when prompted.

```bash
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-sql-cli  \
https://$ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PW@$ELASTIC_ENDPOINT:9200 \
-k /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.p12 
```

Once the command runs, youâ€™ll be in the SQL prompt:

```bash
                       asticElasticE
                     ElasticE  sticEla
