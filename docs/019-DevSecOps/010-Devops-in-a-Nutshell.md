## In a Nutshell

From development to deployment and running code in production, these phases are interconnected, forming a continuous pipeline for your software.

## What is DevOps?

If you ask 100 people to define DevOps, you’ll likely get 100 different answers. This variation highlights DevOps as a flexible philosophy rather than a strict method.

DevOps emphasizes efficient development, deployment, and operations to achieve high-quality software. This adaptability allows each organization to shape DevOps to fit their unique needs.

Though there is no single “right way” to adopt DevOps, some strategies work better than others. For example, creating a dedicated DevOps team can be counterproductive by creating new silos.

On the other hand, cross-functional teams of developers, QA, security, and operations encourage collaboration and support the DevOps philosophy.
