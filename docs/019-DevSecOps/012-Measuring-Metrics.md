## Metrics 

Metrics assess the effectiveness of DevOps practices on pipeline performance and software quality.

- Focus on efficient, high-quality software development, deployment, and operation
- Metrics provide critical insights into overall pipeline performance

## Deployment Frequency

Reflects pipeline health.

- Indicates development activity
- Ideally trending upward during active development
- Stabilizes as software reaches maturity

## Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)

Tracks average time to resolve production issues.

- Measures time to recover from outages
- Time resolving bugs, and security issues affecting users
- Goal is rapid recovery to maintain user experience

Failures are inevitable. Creating flexible software and infrastructure helps minimize impact and improve recovery speed, aiming to reduce failure frequency.

## Mean Time to Discovery (MTTD)

Measures how quickly failures are detected.

- Start point is when an issue is introduced in production, not when itâ€™s discovered
- Detection method could be automated or user-reported, affecting response times

## System Availability

Tracks system uptime and availability of each software component.

- Monitors uptime for components like load balancers, servers, and CDNs
- Low uptime indicates areas needing improvement (e.g., if web servers are only 90% up monthly)

## Service Performance

Identifies performance issues through response times and load times.

- Performance metrics include API response and webpage load times, crucial for optimizing user experience
- Track changes after deployments to pinpoint performance-related code issues

## Customer Complaints

Analyzes customer feedback on issues.

- Track trends to identify frequent issues and improve preventive measures
- Preventive measures reduce recurring problems and support a proactive improvement culture

## Lead Time

Tracks time from feature request to release.

- Goal is rapid delivery without sacrificing quality to maintain efficiency
- Fast turnaround supports experimentation, preventing software stagnation

## Conclusion

These metrics provide insights to enhance the pipeline. They should inform improvements, not impose arbitrary goals.
