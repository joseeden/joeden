## Overview

Automation minimizes the risk of human error and potential "willful sabotage" by standardizing processes.

## Secure Builds

Implementing secure automated steps in the build process is essential. Manual steps are prone to security risks, but automated ones can be consistently protected.

- Validate and check generated artifacts for compliance.
- Digitally sign all build artifacts with approved organization certificates.
- DevSecOps ensures security in the delivery pipeline.
- Implement infrastructure-as-code and configuration-as-code practices.
- Store code in secure repositories with regulated access.

## Secure Tests

Ensuring the security of deployed artifacts across all environments is crucial.

- Use environment variables and configurations to handle differences in deployment.
- Test the security boundaries of the service with both secure and insecure test data.

## Secure Staging

Staging environments must be immutable to maintain consistency and security.

- Test dependencies and integrations in the staging/pre-prod environment.
- Deploy the same artifact to both staging and production.
- Consider data-handling rules like GDPR and PCI compliance for financial and payment-related data.

## Secure Production

Production environments should also be immutable to prevent unauthorized changes.

- Deploy the same artifacts to production as used in staging.
- Ensure compliance with data security regulations such as GDPR, PCI, and SOX.
- Conduct failure testing to aid audit compliance.
- Use dedicated security scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities.
