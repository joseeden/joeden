## Overview 

Relational databases are great for organizing real-world things like customers and products into tables. Each table focuses on one type of thing, which helps avoid repeating the same information. You can also define how different things relate to each other, like a customer purchasing multiple products or a product being bought by several customers.

- Each table focuses on one type of entity.
- Defines relationships between different entities.

## Sample Tables 

Here is the schema for the sample **World** table. This tables we'll be used for the examples in this guide.

## Building a Database

We can begin with a single table and expand it by adding rules like constraints and keys to keep our data accurate and organized.

- Start small and expand our database.
- Use constraints and keys to keep data accurate.

An example of database is PostgreSQL. To explore a PostgreSQL database, we need to use SQL queries. The `information_schema` database has lots of useful details about our database’s setup and works in systems like MySQL and SQL Server.

## Table Columns

To check out table columns, use the `information_schema` database. The "columns" table shows you a table’s column details once you know its name, like how the "products" table might hold columns for product name and price.

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
```

The output would look something like this. Notice that there's are differnt table schemas here: `world`, `cinema`, `public`, and `pg_catalog`.

| Table Schema | Table Name          |
|--------------|---------------------|
| world        | economies           |
| world        | languages           |
| world        | populations         |
| world        | economies2010       |
| world        | countries_plus      |
| world        | currencies          |
| cinema       | descriptions        |
| public       | books               |
| pg_catalog   | pg_type             |
| world        | prime_ministers     |
| world        | states              |

<small>Some records are not shown.</small>

To look at tables with specific schemas, use the `WHERE` command:

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';          -- specify the schema here
```

To list columns of a specific table (e.g., products):

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'states';
```

Output:

| Column Name       | Data Type        |
|-------------------|------------------|
| name              | character varying|
| continent         | character varying|
| indep_year        | integer          |
| fert_rate         | real             |
| women_parli_perc  | real             |



## Redundancies

In the `economies.csv` file, you might notice repeated information about economic data and their related attributes.

- Economic data and related attributes are repeated in the same table.
- Indicates redundancy due to mixing different types of data.

For instance, economic metrics such as GDP per capita and inflation rate are stored together, leading to potential redundancy. This can become evident when sorting or querying the data, showing repeated entries for the same country across different years.

We can see this when we sort by year. The output below shows economic data for a specific year but there are many more records in this table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM economies
ORDER BY year;
```

| Econ ID | Code | Year | Income Group        | GDP per Capita | Gross Savings | Inflation Rate | Total Investment | Unemployment Rate | Exports | Imports |
|---------|------|------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|---------|

## Entity Types

The `economies` table currently stores various types of economic information in a single table, which may lead to some redundancy. For example, it includes `gdp_percapita`, `gross_savings`, and other economic indicators all mixed in one table.

[](/img/docs/db-economies-schemaaa-drawio.png)

Currently, the database holds different types of data (economic indicators, trade data) in the same table. To reduce redundancy, we can separate these into different tables, ensuring each table focuses on a specific aspect of economic data.

A better approach is to divide the data into separate tables: 

- economic_summary

    | **Column Name**    | **Data Type**       |
    |---------------------|---------------------|
    | `econ_id`           | integer             |
    | `code`              | character varying   |
    | `year`              | integer             |
    | `income_group`      | character varying   |

- economic_indicators

    | **Column Name**    | **Data Type**       |
    |---------------------|---------------------|
    | `econ_id`           | integer             |
    | `gdp_percapita`     | real                |
    | `gross_savings`     | real                |
    | `inflation_rate`    | real                |
    | `total_investment`  | real                |
    | `unemployment_rate` | real                |

- trade_data

    | **Column Name**    | **Data Type**       |
    |---------------------|---------------------|
    | `econ_id`           | integer             |
    | `exports`           | real                |
    | `imports`           | real                |

This will help in organizing the data more efficiently and reduce redundancy by storing each type of information in its respective table. The new database model could look like this:

[](/img/docs/db-economies-schemaaa-drawio-divided-into-3.png)


## Creating New Tables

The `CREATE TABLE` command helps define new tables with appropriate columns and data types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
 column_a data_type,
 column_b data_type,
 column_c data_type
);
```

To create the three new databases:

```sql
CREATE TABLE economic_summary (
	econ_id integer,
	code character varying,
	year integer,
	income_group character varying
);


SELECT * FROM economic_summary;
```

Output:

| econ_id |	code | year |income_group |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |


```sql
CREATE TABLE economic_indicators (
	econ_id integer,
	gdp_percapita real,
	gross_savings real,
	inflation_rate real,
	total_investment real,
	unemployment_rate real
);

SELECT * FROM economic_indicators;
```

Output:

| econ_id |	gdp_percapita | gross_savings | inflation_rate | total_investment | unemployment_rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |   |



```sql

CREATE TABLE trade_data (
	econ_id integer,
	exports real,
	imports real
);

SELECT * FROM trade_data;
```


Output:

| econ_id |	exports | imports |
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   | 

## Column operations

- To add a new column to an existing table:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD COLUMN column_name data_type; 
    ```

- To rename columns:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name; 
    ```

- To delete columns:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    DROP COLUMN column_name; 
    ```

## `INSERT INTO`

After changing the database structure, the next step is to migrate the records from the old table to the new table. To do this, we use the `INSERT_INTO` command, followed by the target table. We then use the `SELECT DISTINCT` command followed by the columns or attributes that we want to migrate over.

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table 
SELECT DISTINCT 
    column_1_to_be_moved,
    column_2_to_be_moved,
FROM old_table 
```

It should return an output like the one below. The "1892" specify the number of records inserted to the new table.

```bash
Output: INSERT 0 1892 
```

Note that if we don't use `DISTINCT`, duplicate records will be migrated as well.

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table 
SELECT 
    column_1_to_be_moved,
    column_2_to_be_moved,
FROM old_table 
```
```bash
Output: INSERT 0 2105 
```

The other way to write is by inserting manually. You can insert new columns as well as new values for those columns.

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table (column_a, column_b) 
VALUES ("values_a", "values_b",)
```

## `DROP TABLE` 

Note before dropping any table:

- Ensure you have a recent backup of the table data.
- Verify if the table is referenced by other tables (foreign key constraints). 
- Verify if the table is used in views, stored procedures, or functions.
- Confirm you have the necessary permissions to drop the table.
- Double-check the table to ensure you are dropping the correct one.
- Inform team members or stakeholders about the table drop.
- Document the reason for dropping the table and the steps to be taken.
- If possible, test the drop command in a development or staging environment.


To drop tables and its data, use the command below. 

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name; 
```

Note that it will return an error if the table doesn't exist.

```bash
table "table_name" does not exist 
```

Use this command instead to drop table if it already exists.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name; 
```
