## Approaches to Data Processing 

Two main approaches, OLTP and OLAP, serve different purposes in processing data.

- **OLTP**
  - Designed for handling routine transactions quickly.
  - Used for tasks like tracking book prices and processing sales.
  - Supports daily operations with frequent, simple tasks.
  - Accessible to a wide range of users for smooth operations.

- **OLAP**
  - Focuses on long-term data analysis for decision-making.
  - Used for identifying sales trends and top-selling books.
  - Handles complex queries for comprehensive insights.
  - Accessed mainly by analysts and data scientists.

## Working Together

OLTP and OLAP systems complement each other to enhance data management.

  - OLTP data is extracted for OLAP analysis in data warehouses.
  - OLAP insights refine business practices and influence OLTP transactions.
  - Their synergy turns transactional data into strategic insights.

## Key Takeaways

Choosing the right data processing approach is essential for a functional database system.

  - Identify business requirements to guide database design.
  - Choose OLTP, OLAP, or both based on your goals.
