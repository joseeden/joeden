## What is Agile

Agile is an iterative approach to project delivery designed to quickly create something of value. Unlike traditional project management, which involves a lengthy planning phase, Agile methodologies focus on producing working, viable products in short, incremental cycles. This approach relies on customer input to rapidly launch and improve the product, ensuring that value is delivered to the customer immediately. Feedback from the customer is used from the beginning, shaping and refining the product at every stage to ensure it meets their needs.

There are numerous Agile frameworks, tools, and methods that teams can experiment with and adopt for different projects. The variety of Agile implementations can be overwhelming, but the core focus remains on delivering the most value in the shortest time. This requires staying fast and flexible.

Each step in this playbook offers a glimpse into the Agile process, covering essential considerations and how to ensure each area is effectively addressed.

## Things to Keep in Mind

Your project should focus on delivering benefits and value, whether that is customer value, business value, or financial value. Pay attention to what senior leadership measures and reports, as this will help you understand where you can make the greatest impact. It's important to ask your groupâ€™s leadership which business outcomes matter most and where investments should be directed.

The Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 to guide and improve software development, is based on four values and twelve principles. The four core values of Agile are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Good Questions

- Does my idea or task align with an Agile mindset?
- Who is my sponsor?
- Who is my customer?
