## The Goal

The goal is to align with your stakeholders, especially the project consumers and your project sponsor. Achieving agreement on the objectives before starting the work is crucial, even before the first user story is created.

## Where to Begin

Start by gathering the information needed to reach alignment. Collaborate with your team, key stakeholders, and sponsor to collect the following:

- High-level scope
- High-level release plan
- Customer identification
- Feedback gathering mechanisms
- Acceptance criteria
- Any other factors impacting the project

## Key Questions

| Who to ask                    | Questions |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Questions to Ask Your Sponsor | Does your sponsor understand the project objectives? |
| Questions to Ask Yourself     | Have I identified and addressed as many risks as possible? |
| Questions to Ask the Team     | Have we listed all the project assumptions? |

## Ways to Get It Done

Populate the stakeholder vision document, which serves as an initial agreement on the high-level scope, release plan, customer identification, feedback mechanisms, and acceptance criteria before any code is written. Requirement details will be defined and refined in upcoming iterations.

## You Need Input

Engaging with stakeholders ensures that the project aligns with their expectations and requirements. This collaborative effort helps in identifying potential risks, assumptions, and essential criteria from various perspectives, ultimately leading to a well-rounded and successful project plan.

- Validate objectives and scope with key stakeholders.
- Address concerns and incorporate feedback into the project plan.


## Stakeholder Vision Document

Agile projects focus on delivering a working product to users quickly and enhancing it based on user feedback. Short cyclic scheduling allows for continuous improvement of your product. The Stakeholder Vision Document should include:

- High-level release scope
- High-level release plan
- Customer identification
- Feedback gathering methods
- Acceptance criteria

- **High-level Release Scope**

    ```
    "Create an automated garden box controllable via a smartphone to create ideal plant conditions."
    ```

- **High-level Release Plan**

    - Build
    - Test
    - Gather feedback
    - Launch

- **Customer Identification**

    - Determine who will use the product. Consumers can be internal, external, or both.

- **Feedback Gathering Methods**

  - Gathering feedback from end users is critical in agile methodologies. 
  - It ensures the product meets user needs and adds value. 
  - Methods include:

    - Moderated user testing sessions
    - Remote unmoderated user testing sessions
    - Interviews

- **Acceptance Criteria**

  - Predefined requirements that must be met to consider the product complete.
  - Questions to ask:
        
    - Is the product fully functioning as expected?
    - Is the product tested and verified?
    - Is the product ready for market?
