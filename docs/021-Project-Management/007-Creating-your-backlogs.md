## The Goal

Your team will create and maintain a product backlog, which lists all the work needed for the project. This backlog evolves continuously as the project progresses.

The backlog items serve as the foundation for guiding the projectâ€™s deliverables. It can be managed either physically, using sticky notes on a wall, or digitally with specialized software.

## Your Project Backlog

In agile methodology, work is divided into manageable chunks that can be completed within a sprint:

- **Feature**: Represents a main functionality of the final product.
- **Epic**: Breaks down features into smaller, more manageable chunks of work.
- **User Story**: Specific requirements, small enough to be completed within one iteration.
- **Task**: Individual units of work required to complete user stories.

## Key Questions

Ask yourself:

- Do I understand the value these features provide based on feedback?

Ask your team:

- Do the user stories address who needs the product, what they need, and why?
- Do the user stories logically contribute to epics and product features?

## Create Your Backlog

Start creating your product backlog items collaboratively with your team. This backlog will drive the development of the product.

### Features and Epics

For instance, the product vision focuses on developing software that regulates the environment for plants and soil in GrowBot. As the product owner, prioritize work that delivers the most value.

### Acceptance Criteria

Ensure each feature, epic, user story, and task has clear acceptance criteria. These criteria define when a task is considered complete based on specific outcomes.

Remember, refining the backlog continuously ensures it reflects current priorities and requirements as the project progresses.
