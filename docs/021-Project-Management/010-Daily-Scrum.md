## Overview

The daily scrum, or daily coordination meeting, is a crucial part of agile methodology where team members coordinate their work by addressing three key questions:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What do I plan to do today?
- Is there anything blocking my work?

Team members update their task progress on the Scrum board, moving tasks from “To Do” to “In Progress”, “Blocked”, or “Done”.

Typically held in the morning, this meeting lasts 10-15 minutes and focuses on work coordination rather than status updates.

## Attendance Matters

All team members should attend the daily scrum to gauge sprint progress and identify areas where assistance may be needed.

## Overcoming Obstacles

Team members should raise any barriers preventing them from completing their work. Complex issues are addressed after the meeting in smaller, relevant groups.

## Key Questions

- Has the Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master scheduled the daily meeting?
- Are all team members aware of the meeting's importance?
- Do all team members attend daily, prepared to discuss their tasks and any obstacles?

## Action and Follow-Up

The Scrum Master leads and schedules the meeting, ensuring actions are taken based on the information shared. Regular attendance and active participation help tasks move swiftly from “To Do” to “Done” on the Scrum board.
