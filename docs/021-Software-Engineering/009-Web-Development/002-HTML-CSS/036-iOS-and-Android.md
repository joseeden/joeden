## Button Rendering Issue on iOS

I ran into a problem where a button with text looks fine in Android browsers (single line), but on iOS, the text wraps into two lines. I tested on various devices and screen sizes using DevTools, but the issue still appeared on when viewed in browsers(Safari, Chrome) in actual iPhones.

<div class="img-center">

</div>


### Possible Causes

The issue is likely due to how iOS and Android handle layout and text differently.

- **Font rendering:** iOS may display text slightly wider than Android
- **Button size:** The button may be too narrow on iOS devices
- **Text wrapping:** Text might not be set to stay on one line
- **Viewport/meta tag:** Improper scaling can affect layout on iOS

### Possible Fixes 

1. **Stop text from wrapping**

   Force the text to stay on one line:

    ```css
    button {
      white-space: nowrap;
    }
    ```

   > âœ… This fix worked for me.

2. **Make the button wider**

   Ensure the button has enough space:

    ```css
    button {
      min-width: 100px;
      padding: 0.5em 1.5em;
    }
    ```

3. **Use flexible units**

   Avoid fixed widths; go with responsive sizing:

    ```css
    button {
      width: auto;
      max-width: 90%;
    }
    ```

4. **Watch for text styling**

   Styles like `text-transform: uppercase` can change how wide text appears.

5. **Add viewport tag**

   Ensure your HTML has the correct viewport setting:

    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    ```
