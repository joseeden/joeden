      <h1>Convicted Murderer - Extremely Dangerous</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
      Sirius Black, formerly a trusted ally of the wizarding world, was convicted for the mass murder of twelve Muggles and one wizard, Peter Pettigrew, in broad daylight with a single curse. 
      <br></br>
      A known supporter of the Dark Lord, Black was also implicated in betraying James and Lily Potter to Lord Voldemort, leading to their tragic deaths.  
      <br></br>
      Black escaped from Azkaban Prison, making him the first known wizard to break free from its high-security confinement. His whereabouts remain unknown, and he is considered armed and highly dangerous. Approach with extreme caution and do not attempt to engage.  
      <br></br>
      If spotted, contact the Ministry of Magic immediately. A substantial reward is offered for any information leading to his capture.</p>
