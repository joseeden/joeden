## Overview

JavaScript makes web pages interactive by allowing changes to HTML and CSS while the page is open.  

- HTML and CSS define the structure and style  
- JavaScript enables actions and changes  
- It can modify, add, or remove elements  

With JavaScript, web pages no longer need to reload for updates.  

## Document Object Model (DOM)

When a web page loads, the browser creates the Document Object Model (DOM).  

- DOM represents the page as a structured tree  
- It lets JavaScript access and modify HTML elements  
- The `document` object is how JavaScript interacts with the DOM  

Using the DOM, JavaScript can change elements dynamically.  
 
## DOM Tree Structure  

The DOM is stored in a tree structure, where each element is an object. The document at the top serves as the entry point, and you can use `document.querySelector` to select elements. 

- The first child element is usually the `HTML` element because it is the root of all HTML documents.  
- `HTML` typically has two child elements: `Head` and `Body`.  
- As you go deeper, more child elements are added, forming the complete DOM tree.

## The Window Object  

The `window` object is the top-level object in the browser.  

- `window.document` refers to the DOM  
- `window.alert()` creates an alert box  
- Many built-in functions belong to `window`  

JavaScript interacts with the browser through the window and document objects.  

- The browser loads HTML and CSS  
- The JavaScript engine executes scripts  
- JavaScript modifies the DOM dynamically  


In the example below, we access `window` in the console. It is the main object that contains other objects like `alert` and `document`, which also have their own properties.  

To access properties, use **dot notation**. Notice that the `write` method gives an error when used on `window`. This is because `write` belongs to `document`, not `window`.

## DOM is not JavaScript  

The DOM is part of the Web APIs, which are libraries browsers provide to interact with web pages.  

- JavaScript uses the DOM API to manipulate web pages
- However the DOM itself is **not part of JavaScript**.  
- Other Web APIs include timers, Fetch API, and many more.  

Each browser has a JavaScript engine that reads and executes JavaScript.  

- Chrome: V8  
- Edge: ChakraCore  
- Safari: Nitro  
- Firefox: SpiderMonkey  

## Modifying the DOM  

Modifying the DOM lets JavaScript change a webpageâ€™s content and style instantly. This makes web pages interactive and dynamic.
