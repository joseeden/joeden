This is a simple number guessing game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 20. Input a number, press enter, and get feedback until you find the correct number.  

- If your guess is too low, you'll see "ðŸ‘‡ Too low!"  
- If it's too high, you'll see "ðŸ‘† Too high!"  
- The score starts at 20 and decreases with every incorrect guess  
- Click "Again!" to restart the game
