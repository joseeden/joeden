## Overview

In this case study, we'll use Python functions, iterators, and list comprehensions to analyze World Bank's World Development Indicators dataset. The dataset includes global economic and social indicators over several decades.  

- Covers 217 countries from 1960 to 2015  
- Includes indicators like population, electricity use, and CO2 emissions  
- Tracks literacy rates, unemployment, and mortality  

## Objectives

- **Work with Dictionaries**  
  - Store and retrieve country-level data efficiently  
  - Use keys for quick lookups of indicators  

- **Use List Comprehensions**  
  - Extract specific indicators in a single line  
  - Improve readability and performance  

- **Apply Custom Functions**  
  - Automate data transformations  
  - Handle missing values and format data consistently
