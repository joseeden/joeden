## Functions as Objects

In Python, functions are just another type of object. You can treat them like numbers, strings, lists, or dictionaries.

- Functions can be assigned to variables
- Functions can be stored in lists or dictionaries
- Functions can be passed as arguments or returned from other functions

Because functions are objects, you can store them, pass them around, or manipulate them like any other value.
