## Overview 

Initially, I planned to make all the Jupyter notebooks accessible directly from this website. While researching how to render `.ipynb` files in Docusaurus, I came across several online resources and attempted to implement some of the suggested approaches. Unfortunately, I was not successful.  

Due to time constraints, I decided to store the notebooks on GitHub and provide Google Colab links for each notebook, so that viewers to run the code themselves easily. Viewers will also be able to save a copy of the notebooks.

You can find all the notebooks here: [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/joseeden/joeden/tree/master/docs/021-Software-Engineering/021-Jupyter-Notebooks)
