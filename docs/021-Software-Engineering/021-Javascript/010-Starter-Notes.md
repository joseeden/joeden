Type in the command below and hit enter. NOtice that it won't open an alert window. This is because it is evaluating the `if` condition. Since the `if` condition is not met, then it did not evaluate the alert message.

```bash
let js = 'boring'
if (js === 'amazing') alert('Javascript is FUN!') 
```
