## Practice 1 

Alex and Jake want to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), calculated as:  

```bash
BMI = mass / height² (mass in kg, height in meters)  
```

**Tasks:**  

1. Store Alex's and Jake's weight and height in variables.  
2. Calculate their BMIs using the formula.  
3. Create a Boolean variable `alexHigherBMI` to check if Alex's BMI is higher than Jake's.  

**Test Data:**  

| Data Set | Alex (Weight in kg) | Alex (Height in m) | Jake (Weight in kg) | Jake (Height in m) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Data 1** | 78                  | 1.69                | 92                  | 1.95                |
| **Data 2** | 95                  | 1.88                | 85                  | 1.76                |

<details>
  <summary> **Solution** </summary>

Using first test data:

```js
const dataAlex = { weight: 78, height: 1.69};
const dataJake = { weight: 92, height: 1.95};

function getBMI(weight, height) {
  return (weight / (height * height)).toFixed(2);
}

const bmiAlex = getBMI(dataAlex.weight, dataAlex.height)
const bmiJake = getBMI(dataJake.weight, dataJake.height)

console.log(`Alex has a BMI of ${bmiAlex}`);
console.log(`Jake has a BMI of ${bmiJake}`);

const alexHigherBMI = bmiAlex > bmiJake;
console.log(`Does Alex have a higher BMI than Jake? ${alexHigherBMI}`);
```

Output:

```js
Alex has a BMI of 27.31
Jake has a BMI of 24.19
Does Alex have a higher BMI than Jake? true
```

A simpler way to write this is:

```js
const massAlex = 78, massJake = 92;
const heightAlex = 1.69, heightJake = 1.95;

const BMIAlex = (massAlex / (heightAlex ** 2)).toFixed(2);
const BMIJake = (massJake / (heightJake ** 2)).toFixed(2);
const higherBMI = BMIAlex > BMIJake;

console.log(`Alex has a BMI of ${BMIAlex}`);
console.log(`Jake has a BMI of ${BMIJake}`);
console.log(`Does Alex have a higher BMI than Jake? ${higherBMI}`);
```

Output:

```js
Alex has a BMI of 27.31
Jake has a BMI of 24.19
Does Alex have a higher BMI than Jake? true
```

</details>


## Practice 2

Improve on practice 1, and modify the code to print either of the two:

- `Alex has a higher BMI than Jake.`
- `Jake has a higher BMI than Alex.`

Use the same set of test data.

<details>
  <summary> **Solution** </summary>

Using first test data:

```js
const dataAlex = { weight: 78, height: 1.69};
const dataJake = { weight: 92, height: 1.95};

function getBMI(weight, height) {
  return (weight / (height * height)).toFixed(2);
}

const bmiAlex = getBMI(dataAlex.weight, dataAlex.height)
const bmiJake = getBMI(dataJake.weight, dataJake.height)

console.log(`Alex has a BMI of ${bmiAlex}`);
console.log(`Jake has a BMI of ${bmiJake}`);

function finalBMI() {
  if ( bmiAlex > bmiJake) {
    console.log(`Alex has a higher BMI than Jake.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Jake has a higher BMI than Alex.`);
  }
}

finalBMI();
```

Output:

```js
Alex has a BMI of 27.31
Jake has a BMI of 24.19
Alex has a higher BMI than Jake.
```

Another way to write this:

```js

const massAlex = 78, massJake = 92;
const heightAlex = 1.69, heightJake = 1.95;

const BMIAlex = (massAlex / (heightAlex ** 2)).toFixed(2);
const BMIJake = (massJake / (heightJake ** 2)).toFixed(2);
const higherBMI = BMIAlex > BMIJake;

function finalBMI() {
  if  (BMIAlex > BMIJake) {
    console.log(`Alex has a higher BMI than Jake.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Jake has a higher BMI than Alex.`);
  }
}

console.log(`Alex has a BMI of ${BMIAlex}`);
console.log(`Jake has a BMI of ${BMIJake}`);

finalBMI();
```

Output:

```js
Alex has a BMI of 27.31
Jake has a BMI of 24.19
Alex has a higher BMI than Jake.
```

## Practice 3 

Two athletic teams, **Lions** and **Tigers**, compete in three rounds. The team with the highest average score wins the trophy!  

**Tasks:**  

1. Calculate each team's average score using the test data.  
2. Compare the scores and determine the winner. If both teams have the same average, it's a draw.  
3. A team only wins if its average score is **higher than the other team** and **at least 100 points**.  
4. **Bonus Round:** A draw only happens if both teams have the **same average** and **at least 100 points**. Otherwise, no team wins.  


**Data:**

| Dataset      | Lions Scores     | Tigers Scores    |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Round 1**  | 96, 108, 89      | 88, 91, 110     |
| **Round 2**  | 97, 112, 101     | 109, 95, 123    |
| **Bonus Round**  | 97, 112, 101     | 109, 95, 106    |

  <summary> **Solution** </summary>

To start with, create the function the first set of scores from round 1.

```js
const getAve = (a, b, c) => (a + b + c)/3;
console.log(getAge(86, 108, 90))
```

Now compute for both teams:

```js
const scoreLions = getAve(96, 108, 89);
const scoreTigers = getAve(88, 91, 110);
console.log(scoreLions);                  // Output: 97.66666666666667   
console.log(scoreTigers);                 // Output: 96.33333333333333
```

To round off to two decimal points,

```js
console.log(scoreLions.toFixed(2));       // Output: 97.67  
console.log(scoreTigers.toFixed(2));      // Output: 96.33
```


**The ES6 way of computing average**

As of ES6, the shorter way of computing average:

```js
const average = array => array.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / array.length;
console.log(average([1,2,3,4,5])) 
```

Explanation:

In `reduce((a, b) => a + b)`, the function takes two parameters:  

- `a`: The accumulated sum (starts with the first element by default).  
- `b`: The current element being processed.  

Let's say we have an array:

```js
const mynumbers = [1, 3, 4, 8, 2];
```

If we want to get the average of the list:

```js
const getAverage => getAverage.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / mynumbers.length;
console.log(getAverage(mynumbers));
```

1. **First iteration** → `a = 1`, `b = 3` → `1 + 3 = 4`  
2. **Second iteration** → `a = 4`, `b = 4` → `4 + 4 = 8`  
3. **Third iteration** → `a = 8`, `b = 8` → `8 + 8 = 16`  
4. **Fourth iteration** → `a = 16`, `b = 2` → `16 + 2 = 18`  

Final sum = `18`.  

When divided by the array length (`5`), the average is:  

```js
18 / 5 = 3.6
```


**Going back to the challenge:**

- **Round 1:**

    ```js
    // average is (a + b + c)/number of itema
    // Below is the ES6 way
    const getAve = array => array.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / array.length;

    function checkWinner(scores1, scores2) {
      const aveLions = getAve(scores1).toFixed(2);
      const aveTigers = getAve(scores2).toFixed(2);
      console.log(`Average scores per team:`)
      console.log(`Lions: ${aveLions}\nTigers: ${aveTigers}\n`)

      if (aveLions > aveTigers && aveLions >= 100) {
        console.log(`Lions wins the trophy! 🏆`)
      } else if (aveLions < aveTigers && aveTigers >= 100) {
        console.log(`Tigers wins the trophy! 🏆`)
      } else {
        console.log(`It's a draw!`)
      }
    };

    console.log(`Round 1:`)
    checkWinner(round1Lions, round1Tigers);
    ```

    Output:

    ```js
    Average scores per team:
    Lions: 97.67
    Tigers: 96.33

    Lions wins the trophy! 🏆  
    ```

- **Round 2:**

    ```js
    console.log(`Round 2:`)
    checkWinner(round2Lions, round2Tigers);
    ```

    Output:

    ```js
    Lions average score: 103.33,
    Tigers average score: 109.00
      
    Tigers win the trophy! 🏆 
    ```

- **Bonus Round:**

    ```js
    const round1Lions = [96, 108, 89], 
          round2Lions = [97, 112, 101],
          round3Lions = [97, 112, 101],
          round1Tigers = [88, 91, 110],
          round2Tigers = [109, 95, 123],
          round3Tigers = [109, 95, 106];

    // average is (a + b + c)/number of itema
    // Below is the ES6 way
    const getAve = array => array.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / array.length;

    function checkWinner(scores1, scores2) {
      const aveLions = getAve(scores1).toFixed(2);
      const aveTigers = getAve(scores2).toFixed(2);
      console.log(`Average scores per team:`)
      console.log(`Lions: ${aveLions}\nTigers: ${aveTigers}\n`)

      if (aveLions > aveTigers && aveLions >= 100) {
        console.log(`Lions wins the trophy! 🏆`)
      } else if (aveLions < aveTigers && aveTigers >= 100) {
        console.log(`Tigers wins the trophy! 🏆`)
      } else if (aveLions === aveTigers && aveLions >= 100 && aveTigers >= 100) {
        console.log(`It's a draw! 🏆`)
      }else {
        console.log(`No winner!`)
      }
    };

    console.log(`Bonus Round:`)
    checkWinner(round3Lions, round3Tigers); 
    ```

    Output:

    ```js
    Bonus Round:
    Average scores per team:
    Lions: 103.33
    Tigers: 103.33

    It's a draw! 🏆 
    ```

## Practice 4 

Robin wants a simple tip calculator for dining out. In his country:  

- A **15% tip** is given when the bill is **between 50 and 300** (inclusive).  
- Otherwise, a **20% tip** is applied.  

**Tasks:**  

1. Calculate the tip based on the bill amount. Store it in a variable `tip` (without using `if/else`).  
2. Print a message showing the **bill**, **tip**, and **total amount (bill + tip)**.  

**Test Data:**  

| Bill Amount | Expected Tip | Total Amount |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 275         | 41.25        | 316.25       |
| 40          | 8.00         | 48.00        |
| 430         | 86.00        | 516.00       |  


<details>
  <summary> **Solution** </summary>

Uncomment the lines for the `const bill` to use each test data:

```js
const bill = 275;       // Uncomment to use 1st data
// const bill = 40;     // Uncomment to use 2nd data
// const bill = 430;    // Uncomment to use 3rd data

const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.20;
const total =  bill + tip;
console.log(`Tip: ${tip}`);
console.log(`Total: ${total}`);
```

Output for test data 1:

```js
Bill: 430
Tip: 86
Total: 516 
```
