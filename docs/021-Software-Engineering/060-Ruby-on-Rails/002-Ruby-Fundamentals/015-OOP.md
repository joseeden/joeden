## Overview

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is about using objects to organize and manage data in your programs. 

- **Objects** represent individual things in your program
- **Classes** are blueprints for creating objects
- **Attributes** store information about an object

In the example below, the class (Car) contains attributes that represent the color, brand, and model of a Car object. From this class, we can instantiate two objects that can inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class (Car).

<div class='img-center'>

## Objects and Classes

Everything in Ruby is an object. Objects combine **state** (data) and **behavior** (methods) that define what the object can do.

- Objects store their own data using **instance variables**
- The **class** defines the blueprint for objects
- Classes also define **methods**, which are actions objects can perform

Example: A `Student` class can have attributes like:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `username`

Each student object stores its own values but follows the same blueprint.

```ruby
class Student
  # class blueprint goes here
end
```


## Creating Attributes

Attributes are stored in **instance variables**, which start with `@`. These hold data for each object created from the class.

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(first_name, last_name, email)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
    @email = email
  end
end
```

Each student object can have different values for these variables, but they all share the same class structure.


## Creating Objects

To create an object, use the `new` method on the class.

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(first_name, last_name, email)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
    @email = email
  end
end

student1 = Student.new("Alex", "Smith")
student2 = Student.new("Maria", "Lopez")
```

Printing the object directly shows a default representation:

```ruby
puts student1
```

Output:

```bash
#<Student:0x00007fffa203c8>
```


This is Ruby’s default output using the `to_s` method. This can be customized using methods.


## Methods

Methods are functions defined inside a class that objects can use.

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
  end

  def full_name
    "Full name: #{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end

student = Student.new("Alex", "Smith")
puts student.full_name
```

Output:

```bash
Full name: Alex Smith
```

This allows you to control what each object shows when printed.
