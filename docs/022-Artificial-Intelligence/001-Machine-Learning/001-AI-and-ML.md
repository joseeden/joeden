## Overview 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various fields, including medicine, marketing, HR, and even art. This potential has led to significant investment in AI research and education. But how does AI and machine learning relate to each other?

## Artificial Intelligence 

AI is a broad field encompassing tools to make computers act intelligently while machine learning is a key subset. While AI includes various sub-fields like robotics, machine learning has become the most prevalent in recent decades. Machine learning uses data to make inferences and predictions and it often overlaps with other fields.


## Machine Learning

Machine learning helps us draw insights (inferences) and forecast future events (predictions). It derives its methods from statistics and computer science which enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

- **Inference**: Understanding causes, like "why it rains?"
- **Prediction**: Forecasting events, like "will it rain tomorrow?"

Machine learning learns patterns from existing data and applies these patterns to new data. For instance, it can process archived emails to recognize spam and then identify spam in new emails. 

- Learns patterns from existing data
- Applies learned patterns to new data
- Requires high-quality data for success

## Machine Learning Models

Data science focuses on uncovering and communicating insights from data and it often uses machine learning as a tool. Machine learning models are practical representations of real-world processes and it is used to make predictions based on historical data.

For example, it can forecast traffic based on past trends or determine the probability of a tweet being fake. By entering new inputs into the model, we can get various predictions and probabilities.
