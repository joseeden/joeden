## Overview 

Computer vision aims to enable computers to see and interpret digital images, playing a crucial role in technologies like self-driving cars.

- Help computers understand digital images
- Essential for self-driving cars
- Used by manufacturers like Tesla, Volvo, Audi, and BMW
- Utilizes multiple cameras to detect objects, lane markings, and traffic signs

## Image Data

Understanding how image data is structured is key to grasping how computer vision works. Below is an example of a grayscale and a colored image data and the pixels that makes up the each image.

What an image data looks like:

- Images are made up of pixels containing color and intensity information
- Grayscale images have pixel intensities between 0 and 255

Similarly, we can have 
- Colored images use the RGB system (Red, Green, Blue)
- Requires three rasters for each color channel
- Digital images can be represented as numerical data for machine learning models

## Face Recognition

Building a face recognition system involves processing images to identify individuals.

- Input: Pictures of people, such as instructors
- Neural network processes pixel intensities
- Early neurons detect edges
- Later neurons identify parts of objects (eyes, noses)
- Final neurons recognize face shapes
- Network outputs the identity of the person in the image

Another example is classifying image of vehicles as cars or trucks. The process will look like this:

- The car images are turned into numbers
- The pixel intensities are fed into the neural network
- Neurons will learn to detect edges 
- Neurons will learn to distinguish more complex objects like wheels, doors, and windows
- Neurons will learn to detect shapes of vehicles
- Finally, the image will be classified as either a car or a truck

## Training the Neural Network

Training involves feeding the network large amounts of labeled data to learn patterns.

- Provide images of faces (features) and corresponding identities (labels)
- Learning algorithm figures out neuron computations during training
- Middle layer neurons' functions are determined by the algorithm, reducing the need for manual intervention

## Applications

Computer vision has a wide range of applications, from recognizing objects to generating realistic images.

- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies people from images
- **Self-Driving Vehicles**: Detects objects and navigates safely
- **Medical Imaging**: Automatically detects tumors in CT scans
- **Image Generation**: Creates realistic images, like deep fakes
  - Deep fakes can generate new faces by understanding the structure of human faces
