## Overview

A prompt is more than a question; it is carefully crafted. Effective prompts have three traits:

- **Clarity**: Reduces ambiguity with relevant context.
- **Specificity**: The more specific, the closer to the desired answer.
- **Open-endedness**: Allows for creative and non-obvious results.

Example:

- The context: A chef making a peanut butter sandwich.

    ```
    I'm a chef preparing a unique peanut butter sandwich.
    ```

- Specifics:

    ```
    Create a peanut butter sandwich using whole grain bread, organic peanut butter, and additional ingredients for a gourmet twist.
    ```

- Open-ended:

    ```
    Can you also suggest some unique ingredients or techniques to elevate the flavor and presentation of the sandwich?
    ```

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these pitfalls:

- **Overloading**: Too much information dilutes the query.
- **Ambiguity**: Vague prompts lead to generalized answers.
- **Over-Complication**: Jargon or complex phrasing confuses the model.

## Refinement is Key

Prompts are iterative. Feedback-driven refinement enhances quality, creating a continuous improvement loop. 


## Elements of a Prompt 


- **Instructions**

    - Clear instructions reduce ambiguity. 
    - Instead of "What is the name of the monarch?" 
    - Specify "What is the name of the current monarch in Denmark?"


- **Persona**

    - Adopting a persona ensures relevance and quality. 
    - Instead of "Write me a short story," 
    - Use "You are J.K. Rowling. Write me a short story about magic."


- **Output Format**

    - Specify the desired format. 
    - Example: 
    
        ```
        I'm applying for a job as a data scientist. Create a checklist for how I can best prepare.
        ```

- **Context**

    - Provide background information to guide the response. 
    - Example: 
    
        ```
        Write a summary with 3 bullet points on Charles Duhigg's book "The Power of Habit". What does it says about habit formation?
        ```

## Output Control Techniques

Maximizing ChatGPT's potential isn't just about asking the right questions; it's also about steering responses in the right direction. Think of yourself as guiding an informational orchestra to play exactly what you want.

## Guiding Acronym

To get the best results, use the acronym SALT:

- **Style**: Define the format.
- **Audience**: Tailor the content.
- **Length**: Decide on short or detailed.
- **Tone**: Set the mood.
  
SALT helps ensure your interactions meet your expectations.

### Style

Style shapes the response. Be specific for structured outputs:

- "Describe the solar system" → paragraph
- "List the planets in the solar system" → organized list

Example: "Provide steps to make the perfect blueberry pancake."

### Audience

Tailor prompts to the audience for relevance:

- Simple, engaging explanations for kids.
- Technical details for professionals.

Example: "Explain machine learning like I’m 5."

### Length

Control the response length for concise or detailed answers:

- "Write a haiku about prompt engineering with ChatGPT."
- Snapshot vs. detailed view, choose as needed.

### Tone

Tone adds mood:
- Formal explanation

- Casual chat
- Playful story

Example: "Write a formal recommendation letter for Lauren applying for a senior data science position. Add a humorous sentence about why Mike’s car dealership has the lowest prices in the country at the end of each paragraph." This blends formality with humor effectively.
