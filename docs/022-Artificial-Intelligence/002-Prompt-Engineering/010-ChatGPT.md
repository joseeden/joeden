## Overview

ChatGPT by OpenAI is a versatile chatbot that answers questions and performs tasks based on user input. Unlike traditional chatbots, which provide limited, predetermined responses, ChatGPT uses its understanding of language to generate appropriate replies, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Generative AI

ChatGPT utilizes generative AI, a subset of AI and machine learning. This technology creates new content based on patterns it has learned from previous information.

## From Prompt to Response

- Users write a question or instruction, called a prompt.
- The prompt is input into the application, which interprets it using its language understanding.
- ChatGPT generates and returns a relevant response.


## Applications 

- **Summarizing Text**
  - Excels at summarizing text and explaining concepts
  - Useful for concise reports and interpreting complex information
  - Can summarize generative AI simply without technical jargon

- **Creating Marketing Content**
  - Writes tweets with catchy slogans, relevant hashtags, and emojis
  - Streamlines tasks like crafting email templates and writing blog post titles
  - Helps in copyediting text

- **Generating and Debugging Code**
  - Generates template code
  - Explains issues in code
  - Suggests improvements


## ChatGPT Under the Hood

ChatGPT's text-generation abilities stem from a large language model (LLM). This model interprets prompts and generates text based on its language understanding. To grasp ChatGPT's limitations, it's essential to understand how the LLM functions.

## Demystifying the LLM

Think of a large and complex wall made of building blocks:

- ChatGPT completes an incomplete wall in the same style.
- Analyzes relationships between characters, words, and sentences.
- LLM learned language structure from vast text data 
- Training involved detecting language patterns using complex algorithms.
- LLM was fine-tuned through iterative processes and response quality ratings.

When given a prompt, ChatGPT uses its understanding to generate words that fit the prompt, akin to completing the building block wall.

## Limitations

Although ChatGPT is a powerful tool with a wide range of capabilities, it has some limitations that users should be aware of to utilize it effectively.

### 1. Knowledge Cutoff

ChatGPT's knowledge is limited to its training data's cutoff date, which varies by model. It won't know events or information beyond that date unless updated by OpenAI.

### 2. Training Data Bias

- Trained on diverse text sources, potentially containing biases
- These biases can lead to biased responses

### 3. Context Tracking

- Builds on earlier conversation context for follow-up corrections
- Multiple topic shifts can cause loss of context and inaccuracies
- Best to keep conversations focused on one topic

### 4. Hallucination

- May confidently provide inaccurate information (hallucination)
- Identifying hallucinations is challenging without validation
- Reducing hallucinations is a key focus in LLM development

### 5. Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Example: Writing a song in an artist's style raises ownership questions
- Ownership unclear: user, original artist, or OpenAI
- Properly scoping use cases helps avoid legal gray areas
