## Overview 

The star schema is a basic form of dimensional modeling that uses fact and dimension tables. Some use both the terms "dimensional modeling" and "Star schema" interchangeably. The star schema is made up of two tables:

- **Fact tables**: Hold metrics and change often, with foreign keys to dimension tables.
- **Dimension tables**: Describe attributes, changing less frequently.

In a bookstore example, the start schema can be used to track book sales across the US and Canada.

- Fact tables store sales data such as sales amount and quantity.
- Dimension tables provide details on books, sales time, and stores.
- Structure looks like a star with one-to-many relationships.

## Star Schema Example

In this setup, the fact table holds sales data linked to dimension tables with book, time, and store information. 

<div class='img-center'>

</div>

The schema's star shape comes from the one-to-many connections, with stores involved in many sales but each sale tied to a single store.

- Fact table contains key sales metrics.
- Dimension tables include book, time, and store information.
- One-to-many relationships create the star shape.

### Create the Tables 

Creating the dimension table for books:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dim_book_star (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(256),
    author VARCHAR(256),
    publisher VARCHAR(256),
    genre VARCHAR(128)
);

SELECT * FROM dim_book_star;
```

![](/img/docs/schema-exampless-booksales-book-star.png)


Creating the dimension table for stores:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dim_store_star (
    store_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    store_address VARCHAR(256),
    city VARCHAR(128),
    state VARCHAR(128),
    country VARCHAR(128)
);

SELECT * FROM dim_store_star;
```

![](/img/docs/schema-exampless-booksales-book-dim-store-star.png)


Creating the dimension table for time:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dim_time_star (
    time_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    day INT,
    month INT,
    quarter INT,
    year INT
);

SELECT * FROM dim_time_star;
```

![](/img/docs/schema-exampless-booksales-book-dim-time-star.png)


Creating the fact table for book sales:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_booksales (
    sales_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    time_id INT,
    store_id INT,
    sales_amount FLOAT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES dim_book_star(book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (time_id) REFERENCES dim_time_star(time_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (store_id) REFERENCES dim_store_star(store_id)
);

SELECT * FROM fact_booksales;
```

SELECT * FROM fact_booksales;
```

### Querying the Star Schema 

Here we'll look at the total amount of sales made in each state from books in the novel genre.

```sql
SELECT dim_store_star.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
    JOIN dim_book_star ON dim_book_star.book_id = fact_booksales.book_id
    JOIN dim_store_star ON dim_store_star.store_id = fact_booksales.store_id
WHERE  
    dim_book_star.genre = 'novel'
GROUP BY
    dim_store_star.state; 
```

## Snowflake Schema

The snowflake schema builds on the star schema by adding more tables and normalizing dimension tables. It gets its name because its structure resembles a snowflake.

- Schema has more tables than the star schema.
- Dimension tables are normalized for more detail.

The star schema extends one dimension, while the snowflake schema extends over more than one dimension. This is because the dimension tables are normalized.

</div>


## Normalization

Normalization breaks tables into smaller, connected ones to reduce redundancy and boost data integrity. This involves identifying repeating data and creating new tables. 

- Identifies repeating data groups and create new tables.
- Organizes data effectively with new tables.

In the star schema's book dimension, elements like authors, publishers, and genres repeat. We can create separate tables for these elements, forming a snowflake schema.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/snowflake-schema-breakdown-dim_book_sf.png)

</div>

Cities, states, and countries can have multiple bookstores. This dimension extends over three levels: city, state, and country.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/snowflake-schema-breakdown-dim_store_star.png)

</div>

The time dimension has a hierarchy where days are part of months, which are part of quarters, and so on. 

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/snowflake-schema-breakdown-dim_time_star.png)

</div>

Combining all normalized dimensions together:


<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/snowflake-schema-breakdown-dim-putting-it-all-together.png)

</div>



### Eliminating Redundancy  

Normalization reduces data redundancy, which might seem counterintuitive given the increase in the number of tables. 

- Normalized databases use more tables but eliminate data redundancy.
- In denormalized structures, repeated entries cause redundancy.
- Normalization reduces repeated entries by using separate tables.

In the denormalized table below, repeated entries like "USA," "California," and "Brooklyn" are common, leading to data redundancy.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/eliminate-redundancy-denormalized-database.png)

</div>

In a normalized schema, redundancy is eliminated. For example, "Brooklyn" is stored only once. States like "California" are also stored separately, as many cities share the same state and country.

### Enhancing Data Integrity 

Normalization improves data integrity by enforcing consistency and simplifying data modifications. It reduces duplicates, making updates easier and safer. 

- Ensures data consistency and simplifies modifications.
- Reduces duplicates, making updates easier and safer.
- Smaller tables make schema alterations easier.


### Pros and Cons 

Normalization offers benefits like easier maintenance and reduced redundancy. However, it requires more joins, complicating queries and potentially slowing indexing and data reading. 

- Provides easier maintenance and reduces redundancy.
- Requires more joins, complicating queries.
- Decision depends on database read or write intensity.


### OLTP vs. OLAP Preferences

OLTP and OLAP have different preferences regarding normalization. OLTP is write-intensive while OLAP focuses on read-intensive analytics.

- OLTP benefits from normalization for quick, consistent data addition.
- OLAP avoids normalization to prioritize fast read queries.
- Preferences depend on read or write focus.


## Querying Snowflake Schema 

Using the previous example, we want to see the total sales for novel genres for each state. The schema looks like this:

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/snowflake-schema-breakdown-dim-putting-it-all-together.png)

</div>

To start with, define the basic skeleton of the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
FROM 
WHERE  
```

The filter we want is for novel genres, so we'll define this in the `WHERE` command: 

```sql
SELECT
FROM 
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
```

The expected columns are: `state` and `sum`, where sum is the total sales. We know that the sales records can only be found in the **fact_booksales** table, so we know that it'll be our "base" table. The base table is also called the **facts table.**

```sql
SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
```

This is not yet finish because we have to get the `genre` and `state`.  Let's begin with the `state`. From the "base" table, we can trace the foreign keys-to-primary keys until we reach the table that contains the `state` attribute.

Note that we can also do the other way around - start from the dimension table that contains the `state` attribute and trace the tables until we reach the facts table.

- The **dim_state_sf** table contains the `state` attribute.
- Use `state_id` to "hop" from **dim_state_sf** to **dim_city_sf** table.
- Use `city_id` to "hop" from **dim_city_sf** to **dim_store_sf** table.
- Use `store_id` to "hop" from **dim_store_sf** to **fact_booksales** table. 

To translate this to SQL commands, we can use `JOIN':

```sql
SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
    -- Get state 
    JOIN dim_state_sf ON dim_city_sf.state_id = dim_state_sf.state_id
    JOIN dim_city_sf ON dim_store_sf.city_id = dim_city_sf.city_id
    JOIN dim_store_sf ON fact_booksales.store_id = dim_store_sf.store_id
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
```

However, if we run this query, we'll get an error:

```bash
missing FROM-clause entry for table "dim_city_sf"
LINE 4:     JOIN dim_state_sf ON dim_city_sf.state_id = dim_state_sf...
                                 ^ 
```

The reason for this error is because we did the "reverse route" where we started from the dimension table and traced all the way to the facts table. However, SQL starts at the facts table which is defined by the `WHERE` statement and works its way to the dimension table. 

So we just need to rearrange the command:

```sql
SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
    -- Get state 
    JOIN dim_store_sf ON fact_booksales.store_id = dim_store_sf.store_id
    JOIN dim_city_sf ON dim_store_sf.city_id = dim_city_sf.city_id
    JOIN dim_state_sf ON dim_city_sf.state_id = dim_state_sf.state_id
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
```

If we try to run this again, we'll get another error:

```bash
column "dim_genre_sf" does not exist
LINE 7: WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
              ^ 
```

The reason of this error is because we haven't retrieve the `genre` yet. We can use `JOIN` here as well. 

- The **dim_genre_sf** table contains the `genre` attribute.
- From **fact_booksales** table, we need to reach the **dim_genre_sf** table.
- Use `book_id` to "hop" from **fact_booksales** table to **dim_book_sf** table.
- Use `genre_id` to "hop" from **dim_book_sf** table to **dim_genre_sf** table

Translating to SQL query:

```sql
SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
    -- Get state 
    JOIN dim_store_sf ON fact_booksales.store_id = dim_store_sf.store_id
    JOIN dim_city_sf ON dim_store_sf.city_id = dim_city_sf.city_id
    JOIN dim_state_sf ON dim_city_sf.state_id = dim_state_sf.state_id
    -- Get genre 
    JOIN dim_book_sf ON dim_book_sf.book_id = fact_booksales.book_id
    JOIN dim_genre_sf ON dim_genre_sf.genre_id = dim_book_sf.genre_id
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
```

We can change the order when comparing similar attributes between two different tables. This means that this arrangement:

```sql
    JOIN dim_book_sf ON dim_book_sf.book_id = fact_booksales.book_id
    JOIN dim_genre_sf ON dim_genre_sf.genre_id = dim_book_sf.genre_id
```

is the same as:

```sql
    JOIN dim_book_sf ON fact_booksales.book_id = dim_book_sf.book_id 
    JOIN dim_genre_sf ON dim_book_sf.genre_id = dim_genre_sf.genre_id
```

To remove confusion, we'll just follow the same order for all `JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
    -- Get state 
    JOIN dim_store_sf on dim_store_sf.store_id = fact_booksales.store_id 
    JOIN dim_city_sf on dim_city_sf.city_id = dim_store_sf.city_id
	JOIN dim_state_sf on  dim_state_sf.state_id = dim_city_sf.state_id
    -- Get genre 
    JOIN dim_book_sf ON dim_book_sf.book_id = fact_booksales.book_id
    JOIN dim_genre_sf ON dim_genre_sf.genre_id = dim_book_sf.genre_id
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
```

If we try to run this, we'll get another error:

```bash
column "dim_state_sf.state" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
LINE 1: SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
               ^ 
```

This error is related to the `SUM` function in the `SELECT` statement. When we use aggregate functions like SUM() and also select other columns, those columns must either be included in a GROUP BY clause or used within an aggregate function themselves. This ensures that the query knows how to group the non-aggregated data.

Basically, the `SUM(sales_amount)` is aggregated but `dim_state_sf.state` is not. So we need to group the results by `dim_state_sf.state`:

```sql
SELECT dim_state_sf.state, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM fact_booksales
    -- Get state 
    JOIN dim_store_sf on dim_store_sf.store_id = fact_booksales.store_id 
    JOIN dim_city_sf on dim_city_sf.city_id = dim_store_sf.city_id
	JOIN dim_state_sf on  dim_state_sf.state_id = dim_city_sf.state_id
    -- Get genre 
    JOIN dim_book_sf ON dim_book_sf.book_id = fact_booksales.book_id
    JOIN dim_genre_sf ON dim_genre_sf.genre_id = dim_book_sf.genre_id
WHERE dim_genre_sf.genre = 'novel'
GROUP BY dim_state_sf.state;
```

Finally, it returns an output:
