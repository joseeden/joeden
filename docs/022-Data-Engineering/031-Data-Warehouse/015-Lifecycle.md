## Overview  

A data warehouse goes through key stages: planning, implementation, and maintenance. Each phase involves different roles and tasks.

## Planning  

This phase is all about understanding what data is needed and how it will be structured.

- **Gather Requirements**  
  - Identify data needs and users.  
  - Example: A data analyst and a data scientist use the warehouse for reports and machine learning.  

- **Data Modelling**  
  - Plan how data will be structured and linked.  
  - Example: Data engineers build pipelines, database admins manage source systems.  

## Implementation  

Now that planning is done, it’s time to build and set up everything.

- **Build ETL Pipelines**  
  - Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into the warehouse.  
  - Expected output: A cleaned dataset ready for analysis.  

- **Develop BI Tools**  
  - Set up reporting tools like Power BI or Tableau.  
  - Example: Connecting a BI dashboard to query the warehouse.  

## Support/Maintenance  

This phase ensures that everything keeps running smoothly and meets business needs.

- **Modify & Optimize**  
  - Update table structures as needed.  
  - Make any required modifications. 

- **Test & Deploy**  
  - Analysts and Data Scientists consult on BI tool setup.
  - Data Engineers deploy the data warehouse.
  - Analysts validate data, engineers push updates.
