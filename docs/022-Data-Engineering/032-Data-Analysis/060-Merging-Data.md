## Overview

In data analysis, merging combines two datasets into one based on a common column or index. Pandas provides powerful functions like `merge()` for this purpose.

Example tables:

**Table A**:  

| x   | y   | z   |  
|-----|-----|-----|  
| 1   | 10  | 20  |  
| 2   | 15  | 25  |  
| 3   | 20  | 30  |  

**Table B**:  
| x   | y   | w   |  
|-----|-----|-----|  
| 1   | 50  | 100 |  
| 2   | 60  | 110 |  
| 4   | 70  | 120 |  

First, make sure to create the dataframes:

```python
import pandas as pd

table_a = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 3],
    'y': [10, 15, 20],
    'z': [20, 25, 30]
})

table_b = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': [1, 2, 4],
    'y': [50, 60, 70],
    'w': [100, 110, 120]
})
```

To merge Table A and Table B on column "x":

```python
merged_data = table_a.merge(table_b, on='x')
print(merged_data)
```

Output:

| x   | y_x | z   | y_y | w   |  
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|  
| 1   | 10  | 20  | 50  | 100 |  
| 2   | 15  | 25  | 60  | 110 |

## Set Custom Suffixes

To distinguish columns with the same name, you can use the `suffixes` parameter.

```python
merged_data_custom = table_a.merge(table_b, on='x', suffixes=('_A', '_B'))

print(merged_data_custom)
```

**Output:**
| x   | y_A | z   | y_B | w   |  
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|  
| 1   | 10  | 20  | 50  | 100 |  
| 2   | 15  | 25  | 60  | 110 |  


## Merging Multiple DataFrames

Merging multiple DataFrames allows you to combine related data from different tables into a single table for analysis. This is useful when data is spread across multiple sources.

To merge two tables:  

```python
merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='id')
```  

To merge three tables:

```python
merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='id') \
  .merge(df3, on='id')
```  


To merge four tables (and so on):

```python
merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='id') \
  .merge(df3, on='id') \
  .merge(df4, on='id')
```

## Left Join  

A **left join** keeps all rows from the left table and only matching rows from the right table. 

<div class="img-center"> 

![](/img/docs/joins-left-join.png)

</div>


**Example**: Two tables, "left" and "right," merged on column C 

  - All rows from "left" are included  
  - Only matching rows from "right" are included  
  - If no match, right-side values are null  

As an example, we'll use the following tables:

- `movies`

    - Contains movie details
    - Title, popularity, and unique ID  

        | movie_id | title              | popularity |  
        |----------|--------------------|------------|  
        | 1        | Inception          | 90.5       |  
        | 2        | Interstellar       | 87.3       |  
        | 3        | The Dark Knight    | 95.0       |  
        | 4        | Tenet              | 75.2       |  
        | 5        | Dunkirk            | 80.4       |  
        | 6        | Memento            | 70.1       |  

- `taglines`

    - Contains movie taglines:  
    - Movie ID and tagline text  

        | movie_id | tagline                         |  
        |----------|---------------------------------|  
        | 1        | "Your mind is the scene of the crime." |  
        | 2        | "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here." |  
        | 3        | "Welcome to a world without rules." |  
        | 5        | "When 400,000 men couldn’t get home, home came for them." |  

To combine the tables using a left join:  

- Merge on the `movie_id` column  
- Use `how='left'` to specify a left join  
- Movies without a matching tagline get a null value (NaN in pandas)  

The code:

```python
import pandas as pd

movies = pd.DataFrame({
    'movie_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    'title': ["Inception", "Interstellar", "The Dark Knight", "Tenet", "Dunkirk", "Memento"],
    'popularity': [90.5, 87.3, 95.0, 75.2, 80.4, 70.1]
})

taglines = pd.DataFrame({
    'movie_id': [1, 2, 3, 5],
    'tagline': [
        "Your mind is the scene of the crime.",
        "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.",
        "Welcome to a world without rules.",
        "When 400,000 men couldn’t get home, home came for them."
    ]
})

merged_table = movies.merge(taglines, on="movie_id", how="left")
print(merged_table)
```

Expected output:

| movie_id | title            | popularity | tagline                                         |  
|----------|----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
| 1        | Inception       | 90.5       | "Your mind is the scene of the crime."         |  
| 2        | Interstellar    | 87.3       | "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here." |  
| 3        | The Dark Knight | 95.0       | "Welcome to a world without rules."            |  
| 4        | Tenet           | 75.2       | **NaN** (no match found)                       |  
| 5        | Dunkirk         | 80.4       | "When 400,000 men couldn’t get home, home came for them." |  
| 6        | Memento         | 70.1       | **NaN** (no match found)                       |  

To count the number of rows with missing taglines, we can use `isnull()` function to find the rows then count them using `sum()`.

```python
missing = merged_table['tagline'].isnull().sum()
print(missing)
```

This will return the number of rows, which is only two rows.


## Right Join

A **right join** returns all rows from the right table and only matching rows from the left table. If no match is found, columns from the left table will be null.  

<div class="img-center"> 

![](/img/docs/joins-right-join.png)

</div>


Example tables:  

- `movies`

    | id | title              | popularity |  
    |----|--------------------|------------|  
    | 1  | Inception         | 90.5       |  
    | 2  | Interstellar      | 87.3       |  
    | 3  | The Dark Knight   | 95.0       |  
    | 4  | Tenet             | 75.2       |  
    | 5  | Dunkirk           | 80.4       |  
    | 6  | Memento           | 70.1       |  

- `tv_genre`

    | movie_id | genre    |  
    |----------|---------|  
    | 3        | Action  |  
    | 5        | War     |  
    | 7        | TV Movie |  
    | 8        | TV Movie |  

We use **pandas** to perform a right join. Note that the `movies` table uses `id`, while the `tv_genre` table uses `movie_id`.  

```python
import pandas as pd

movies = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    'title': ["Inception", "Interstellar", "The Dark Knight", "Tenet", "Dunkirk", "Memento"],
    'popularity': [90.5, 87.3, 95.0, 75.2, 80.4, 70.1]
})

tv_genre = pd.DataFrame({
    'movie_id': [3, 5, 7, 8],
    'genre': ["Action", "War", "TV Movie", "TV Movie"]
})


# Performing the Right Join
merged_table = movies.merge(tv_genre, left_on="id", right_on="movie_id", how="right")
print(merged_table)
```

Expected output:

| id        | title             | popularity | movie_id | genre    |  
|-----------|-------------------|------------|----------|----------|  
| 3         | The Dark Knight   | 95.0       | 3        | Action   |  
| 5         | Dunkirk           | 80.4       | 5        | War      |  
| **NaN**   | **NaN**           | **NaN**    | 7        | TV Movie |  
| **NaN**   | **NaN**           | **NaN**    | 8        | TV Movie |  



## Self Join 

Merging a table to itself, also called a **self join**, helps link related data within the same table. Self joins are useful for:  

- **Hierarchical data** (e.g., employees and managers)  
- **Sequential relationships** (e.g., logistics tracking)  
- **Graph data** (e.g., social networks)    

As an example, let's use the 'sequels` table which contains:

- `movie_id`: Unique ID for each movie  
- `title`: Movie name  
- `sequel`: ID of its sequel (if any)  


| movie_id | title      | sequel |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 862      | Toy Story | 863    |
| 863      | Toy Story 2 | 10193  |
| 10193    | Toy Story 3 | NULL   |
  
To display movies with their sequels in one row, we merge the table to itself.  

```python
import pandas as pd  

sequels = pd.DataFrame({  
    "movie_id": [862, 863, 10193],  
    "title": ["Toy Story", "Toy Story 2", "Toy Story 3"],  
    "sequel": [863, 10193, None]  
})  

# Self merge  
merged = sequels.merge(sequels,
                       left_on="sequel",
                       right_on="movie_id",  
                       suffixes=("_org", "_seq"))  

# Print only these 2 columns
result = merged[["title_org", "title_seq"]]  
print(result)
```

Output:

```
     title_org     title_seq
0   Toy Story  Toy Story 2
1  Toy Story 2  Toy Story 3
```

## Merging on Indexes  

Merging tables isn't limited to columns. We can also merge using indexes, which are often unique identifiers in DataFrames.  

### Table with an Index 

Tables usually have an auto-incrementing index, but we can also set a specific column (like `id`) as the index.  

```python
import pandas as pd  

movies = pd.DataFrame({  
    "id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],  
    "title": ["Inception", "Titanic", "Avatar", "Interstellar", "The Dark Knight", "Pulp Fiction", "Forrest Gump", "The Matrix"]  
}).set_index("id")  # Setting 'id' as the index  

print(movies)
```  

Output:

```
                title  
id                    
1          Inception  
2            Titanic  
3            Avatar  
4      Interstellar  
5  The Dark Knight  
6     Pulp Fiction  
7     Forrest Gump  
8       The Matrix  
```  

### Setting an Index 

We can set the index when reading a CSV using `index_col` in `read_csv()`.  

```python
movies = pd.read_csv("movies.csv", index_col="id")  
```  

This ensures `id` is the index when loading the table.  

### Merging on Index  

We can merge two tables using their index instead of a column. If the index name is `id`, the merge method accepts it just like a column name.  

Create the `taglines` table:

```python
taglines = pd.DataFrame({  
    "id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],  
    "tagline": [  
        "Your mind is the scene of the crime.",  
        "Nothing on Earth could come between them.",  
        "Enter the world of Pandora.",  
        "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.",  
        "Welcome to a world without rules.",  
        "You won't know the facts until you've seen the fiction.",  
        "Life is like a box of chocolates.",  
        "Reality is a thing of the past."  
    ]  
}).set_index("id")  
```

Now merge the `taglines` table to the `movies` table.

```python
merged_df = movies.merge(taglines, on="id", how="left")  
print(merged_df)  
```  

Output:

```
                title                                         tagline  
id                                                                     
1          Inception        Your mind is the scene of the crime.  
2            Titanic  Nothing on Earth could come between them.  
3            Avatar             Enter the world of Pandora.  
4      Interstellar  Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.  
5  The Dark Knight      Welcome to a world without rules.  
6     Pulp Fiction  You won't know the facts until you've seen the fiction.  
7     Forrest Gump      Life is like a box of chocolates.  
8       The Matrix      Reality is a thing of the past.  
```  

Here, `id` is the index, and the output retains the same structure, just with `id` as the index.  

### MultiIndex Merge  

Some tables have multiple levels of indexing, such as movie and cast IDs. We can merge on multiple index levels just like merging on multiple columns.  

Create the `samuel` and `cast` tables.

```python
samuel = pd.DataFrame({  
    "movie_id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],  
    "cast_id": [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108],  
    "actor": ["Samuel L. Jackson"] * 8  
}).set_index(["movie_id", "cast_id"])  

cast = pd.DataFrame({  
    "movie_id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],  
    "cast_id": [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108],  
    "role": ["Agent", "Detective", "Soldier", "Explorer", "Vigilante", "Hitman", "Runner", "Hacker"]  
}).set_index(["movie_id", "cast_id"])  
```

Merge the `cast` table to the `samuel` table using the two indexes.

```python
merged_df = samuel.merge(cast, on=["movie_id", "cast_id"], how="inner")  
print(merged_df)  
```  

Output:

```
                               actor        role  
movie_id cast_id                             
1        101      Samuel L. Jackson      Agent  
2        102      Samuel L. Jackson  Detective  
3        103      Samuel L. Jackson    Soldier  
4        104      Samuel L. Jackson   Explorer  
5        105      Samuel L. Jackson  Vigilante  
6        106      Samuel L. Jackson     Hitman  
7        107      Samuel L. Jackson     Runner  
8        108      Samuel L. Jackson     Hacker  
```  

Since it's an inner join, only matching `movie_id` and `cast_id` pairs appear in the result.  

### Index Merge with `left_on` and `right_on` 

If index names differ between tables, we use `left_on` and `right_on` while setting `left_index` and `right_index` to `True`.  

```python
movies_to_genres = pd.DataFrame({  
    "movie_id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],  
    "genre": ["Sci-Fi", "Romance", "Sci-Fi", "Sci-Fi", "Action", "Crime", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"]  
}).set_index("movie_id")  

merged_df = movies.merge(movies_to_genres,  
                         left_on="id",
                         right_on="movie_id",
                         left_index=True,
                         right_index=True)  
print(merged_df)  
```  

Output:

```
                title     genre  
id                             
1          Inception   Sci-Fi  
2            Titanic  Romance  
3            Avatar   Sci-Fi  
4      Interstellar   Sci-Fi  
5  The Dark Knight   Action  
6     Pulp Fiction    Crime  
7     Forrest Gump    Drama  
8       The Matrix   Sci-Fi  
```  

This tells Pandas to match the `id` index of `movies` with the `movie_id` index of `movies_to_genres`.
