## Overview

Data storytelling helps translate complex insights into meaningful actions.  

- **Clear & Simple** – Focus on the core message.  
- **Concrete** – Use relatable, real-world examples.  
- **Credible** – Support with data and logical reasoning.  

## Why Stories Matter  

Stories make data insights more impactful.  

- **Data Alone Isn't Enough** – Even strong results can be ignored if not communicated well.  
- **Overcoming Resistance** – Helps non-technical stakeholders understand and embrace change.  

## What is Data Storytelling?

A structured way to present insights with narratives and visuals.  

- **Memorable & Engaging** – Stories are easier to remember than raw numbers.  
- **Provides Context** – Helps audiences understand why the data matters.  
- **Drives Action** – Insights become decision-making tools.  

## Building a Strong Data Story  

Two key principles help shape effective storytelling.  

- **The Three-Minute Story** – Focus on what matters most if you had only three minutes.  
- **The Big Idea** – Clearly define the unique message in a single sentence.  

## Key Elements of a Data Story  

A data story is built on three essential components.  

- **Data** – Reliable insights that lead to action.  
- **Narrative** – A clear, structured storyline.  
- **Visuals** – Simple, accurate, and relevant graphics.  

### Data  

Effective data storytelling relies on trustworthy insights.  

- **Use Reliable Data** – Only include verified and relevant findings.  
- **Make It Actionable** – Insights should lead to clear next steps.  

### Narrative  

A strong story guides the audience through a logical flow.  

- **Stay Focused** – Avoid unrelated details.  
- **Know Your Audience** – Tailor the story to their needs.  
- **Follow a Sequence** – Each point should build toward the conclusion.  

### Visuals  

Data visuals should be clear and honest. Avoid misleading graphs and choose accurate and easy-to-read charts.
