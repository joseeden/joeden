## Overview

Before telling a data story, we must define our audience's technical level.  

- **Technical vs. Non-Technical**  
  - Technical audiences care about methods and models.  
  - Non-technical audiences focus on results and impact.  

- **Assessing Technical Proficiency**  
  - A Director of Analytics understands more than an HR Generalist.  
  - Supply chain specialists care about business impact, not model details.  

## How Much Detail?

Tailor explanations based on the audience’s needs.  

**Example:** Explaining prediction accuracy to supply chain specialists:  

- They don’t need details on model tuning.  
- They do need to know that better data entry improves accuracy, reducing returns and shipping issues.  

## Make Results Engaging

Insights that are easy to understand helps drive action.  

- **Tell a Story**

  - Help non-technical stakeholders grasp insights.  
  - Support better decision-making and change.  

- **Use Smart Communication**  

  - Use clear and simple language.
  - Add relatable examples and visuals.  

## Know Your Audience 

Adjust explanations based on what the audience already knows.  

**Key Questions:**  

- What is their background?  
- How much detail do they need?  
- What will help them make informed decisions?  

**Example:** Instead of listing correlation coefficients, explain how customer traits influence purchasing behavior.  

## ADEPT Framework  

A simple way to explain complex ideas.  

- **Analogy** – Connect new concepts to familiar ones.  
- **Diagram** – Use visuals to clarify.  
- **Example** – Show real-world applications.  
- **Plain English** – Keep language simple and clear.  
- **Technical Definition** – Provide precise terms when needed.  

## Use Analogies  

Analogies simplify complex topics.  

**Example:** Explaining neural networks  

  - **Technical:** "Neural networks use forward and backward propagation for learning."  
  - **Simple:** "A neural network learns like a child getting feedback on what’s right and wrong."  

## Avoid Technical Jargon  

Jargon and acronyms can confuse audiences.  

- Define acronyms the first time.
- Replace jargon with common terms.
- Add a reference guide if needed.

## Focus on Impact

Stakeholders care about outcomes, not methods.  

- Instead of model mechanics, highlight revenue growth.
- When introducing tech, explain time and efficiency gains.  

## Keep It Clear

Not all technical details can be removed.  

- Keep the audience engaged
- Encourage questions.  
- Check for understanding.  
- Be ready to explain concepts in different ways.
