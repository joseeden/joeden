## Overview

A strong narrative makes data insights meaningful and drives action.  

- **Keep It Simple** – Focus on key points that matter.  
- **Make It Relevant** – Connect data to real-world problems.  
- **Guide the Audience** – Present information in a logical flow.  

## Structuring the Story  

A clear structure makes the story easy to follow.  

- **Background** – Explain the problem and why it matters.  
- **Evidence** – Show data that supports the issue.  
- **Insights** – Uncover the root causes.  
- **Climax** – Highlight the most important discovery.  
- **Call to Action** – Suggest solutions and next steps.

## Example: Presenting the Data

Imagine presenting to a snack company.  

1. **Background** – Profits dropped for three quarters, contrary to management expectations.  
2. **Evidence** – Chip sales rose 20%, but sweet item sales dropped 30%.  
3. **Insights** – The company’s best-selling chocolate saw a 50% decline.  
4. **Key Finding** – If nothing changes, the company could lose $10 million next year.  
5. **Call to Action** – Rebrand the chocolate and offer discounts to boost profits by 20%.  

## Example: Customer Churn 

Using a clear story structure, we can create a report that influences stakeholders and drives change.

1. Use a line plot to show churn rising from 5% to 15%.  
2. Show boxplots linking churn to customers with dependents.  
3. Highlight that DSL users with dependents churn more.  
4. Use a bar plot to reveal monthly charges as a key factor.  
5. Recommend discounts to retain customers, showing a 10% revenue boost.

## Data-Driven Narratives  

Different approaches can shape the story.  

- **Trends Over Time** – Sales dip in summer but rise in winter.  
- **Relationships** – Higher chocolate prices lead to lower customer ratings.  
- **Comparisons** – Kids prefer sweets, while adults buy more dark chocolate.  
- **Segmentation** – Identify high vs. low chocolate and coffee consumers.  

A well-structured narrative ensures the audience stays engaged and understands the impact.
