## Overview

We need to select data that supports our message without overwhelming the audience.  

- **Keep it relevant**  
  - Avoid unnecessary details.  
  - Focus on key insights that drive decisions.  

- **Ensure quality**  
  - Bad data leads to bad conclusions.  
  - Reliable data improves the credibility of our findings.  

## Understanding the Audience  

Different people interpret data differently. Tailoring our message ensures clarity.  

- **Executives**  
  - Need high-level insights.  
  - Use clear visuals and business impact summaries.  

- **Project Managers**  
  - Interested in costs, risks, and growth metrics.  
  - Present numbers that support decision-making.  

- **Technical Teams**  
  - Require detailed reports.  
  - Share methodologies and technical explanations.  

- **General Audience**  
  - May have limited technical knowledge.  
  - Focus on the impact and key takeaways.  

## Handling Skepticism  

Some people may doubt our results. We need to be prepared.  

- **Test our reasoning**  
  - If we can’t convince ourselves, we can’t convince others.  

- **Address doubts logically**  
  - Provide additional data if needed.  
  - Use step-by-step explanations for clarity.
