## Overview

Data storytelling is about presenting data in a way that tells a clear and engaging story. Visualizations play a big part in this, but we also need to focus on our message and audience.  

## The Right Visualization  

To effectively communicate a message, pick a visualization that fits the audience's understanding.  

- Technical audiences can handle complex graphs like density plots.  
- Non-technical audiences prefer simpler visuals like histograms.  

## Different Audiences  

Different audiences need different information. 

- **For Investors**  
  - Share high-level graphs.  
  - Show monthly revenue forecasts.  
  - Display scenarios like launching or not launching a marketing campaign.

- **For Technical Leads**  
  - Show graphs with detailed model performance.  
  - Focus on how the model performed with historical data.

## Provide Context  

Each visualization should offer context to help the audience understand the data better.  

- **For Investors**  
  - Include information on factors affecting customer buying decisions.  
  - For example, higher prices lead to fewer purchases.

  - Show the importance of different features in the model.

## Simplify Data  

Focus on the most important data. Not all data contributes directly to the message.  

- **Reduce Noise**  
  - Aggregate similar data to avoid overwhelming the audience.  
  - Example: Group  products together instead of showing each individually.  

- **Simplify Visuals**  
  - Simple visuals are often more effective than complex ones.  
  - The goal is to help the audience grasp insights quickly.  

## McCandless Method  

David McCandless, a data journalist, developed a method for presenting data effectively.  

- **Headline**  
  - Give the graph a clear, concise headline.  
  - The headline Should introduce the visualization.
  - Focus the audience’s attention.  

- **Anticipate Questions**  
  - Answer common questions before they are asked.  
  - Key questions: 
    - Where does this data come from?
    - Why focus on this feature?

- **Clarify Insights**  
  - Explicitly explain what the audience is seeing.  
  - Don’t assume they will figure it out on their own.  

- **Make It Relatable**  
  - Help the audience relate to the data.  
  - Show how the insights connect to other parts of the story.  
  - Example: Explain how chocolate sales affect marketing strategies.
