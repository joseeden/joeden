## Overview

Effective communication shares key project information clearly and in an engaging way. The format should be easy to understand and fit the situation.

## Written vs Oral

When presenting data, there are two main formats to consider: 

- **Written Reports**  
  - For documentation or sharing detailed information.  
  - Can be referenced later for review and deeper analysis.  

- **Oral Presentations**  
  - Useful for direct interaction and immediate feedback.  
  - Good for discussions and making quick decisions.

- **Audience**  
  - Who will receive the information? 
  - What do they need to know?  
  - Are they making decisions or starting new projects?  

- **Content**  
  - What is the most important message?  
  - Should the focus be on results, conclusions, or methods?  

- **Requirements**  
  - Does the audience have time for a long report?
  - Is a short meeting better?  
  - Are they in different time zones?
  - Do they prefer written communication instead?  

- **Channel**  
  - Will it be delivered in person or via email/Slack?  
  - How large will the audience be? 

## Written Communication  

Written formats are valuable for sharing detailed, lasting records.  

- **Advantages**  
  - Provides a permanent record that can be reviewed over time.  
  - Good for technical audiences who need code or methodology details.  
  - Easier to share with a large audience.  

- **Challenges**  
  - Immediate feedback is harder to gather, as comments comes later.  
  - Lacks personal touch and direct engagement.  

## Oral Communication  

Oral presentations allow for more dynamic interactions.  

- **Advantages**  
  - Builds relationships and allows for real-time feedback.  
  - Body language and tone add meaning to the message.  

- **Challenges**  
  - No permanent record unless recorded.  
  - Longer presentations can lead to audience disengagement.
