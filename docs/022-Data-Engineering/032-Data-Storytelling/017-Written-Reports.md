## Report Structure

Reports should follow a clear structure. 

### Introduction

The introduction explains the reportâ€™s purpose and provide context. 

- **Contextual Information**
  - State why the report was written. 
  - Example: To address an increase in negative reviews.

- **Analysis Questions** 
  - Define the key questions.
  - Example: What factors lead to bad user experiences?

### Body Sections

This is the body of the report. 

- **Data Section**

  - Include tables or charts for clarity.
  
- **Method Section** 
  - Explain the methods used.
  - Example: NLP and machine learning models.

### Conclusion Section

The conclusion restates the analysis questions.

## Business Context

When writing for business, adapt the structure to the audience's needs. Use the **1-3-25 approach**:

- 1 page for an abstract
- 3 pages for an executive summary
- 25 pages for detailed findings

The executive summary should help readers quickly understand your conclusions and decide if they want to read further.

## Consider the Audience 

Different stakeholders will be interested in different parts of the report:

- **Time-constrained readers** 
  - Will focus on the introduction and conclusion
  - They will scan the body for key points.
  
- **Executive Team** 
  - They care about the introduction, conclusion, and recommendations.

- **Technical Stakeholders** 
  - Focus on the body to review the methods
  - Validates the analysis.

## Writing the Report

Clear and precise writing helps avoid confusion and ensures stakeholders understand the message. 

- **Avoid Empty Phrases**  
  - Remove phrases like "It is interesting to note that."  
  - Stick to straightforward statements.  
  - Be direct and to the point.  

- **Use Concrete Nouns**  
  - Avoid vague pronouns like "this" or "that."  
  - Be specific about what you're referring to.  
  - Example: 
    - Incorrect: "This model shows an accuracy of 80% in predicting customer churn" - Correct: "The model shows an accuracy of 80% in predicting customer churn."

- **Prefer Active Voice**  
  - Active voice is clearer and easier to read. 
  - Example: 
    - Active: "The data shows trends" 
    - Passive: "Trends are shown by the data"

- **Eliminate Redundant Words**  
  - Avoid unnecessary adjectives or adverbs
  - Not useful: "introducing the new" or "done previously."  
  - Keep your writing concise.  

- **Fix Run-On Sentences**  
  - Break long sentences into smaller ones.  
  -Use conjunctions like "because" or "so" to connect ideas.
