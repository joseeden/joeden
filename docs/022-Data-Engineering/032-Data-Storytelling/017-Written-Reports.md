## Report Structure

Reports should follow a clear structure. 

### Introduction

The introduction explains the reportâ€™s purpose and provide context. 

- **Contextual Information**
  - State why the report was written. 
  - Example: To address an increase in negative reviews.

- **Analysis Questions** 
  - Define the key questions.
  - Example: What factors lead to bad user experiences?

### Body Sections

This is the body of the report. 

- **Data Section** 
  - Describe the data used in your analysis. 
  - Include tables or charts for clarity.
  
- **Method Section** 
  - Explain the methods used.
  - Example: NLP and machine learning models.

- **Analysis Section** 
  - Present the data and analysis
  - Use visuals such as graphs. 
  - Example: A graph with most common words.

### Conclusion Section

The conclusion restates the analysis questions.

- Summarize key findings.

## Business Context

When writing for business, adapt the structure to the audience's needs. Use the **1-3-25 approach**:

- 1 page for an abstract
- 3 pages for an executive summary
- 25 pages for detailed findings

The executive summary should help readers quickly understand your conclusions and decide if they want to read further.

## Consider the Audience 

Different stakeholders will be interested in different parts of the report:

- **Time-constrained readers** 
  - Will focus on the introduction and conclusion
  - They will scan the body for key points.
  
- **Executive Team** 
  - They care about the introduction, conclusion, and recommendations.

- **Technical Stakeholders** 
  - Focus on the body to review the methods
  - Validates the analysis.
