## Overview 

For reliable results, it's important to ensure your analysis is both reproducible and replicable.

- **Reproducibility**  
  - Running the same analysis should produce identical results.  
  - Ensures consistency in findings.  

- **Replicability**  
  - Use different tools but follow the same process.  
  - Shows methods can be adapted and reused.  

## Benefits 

These qualities help prevent wasted effort and allow others to build on your work.  

- **Peer Review**  
  - Enables others to verify and improve your work.  
  - Promotes collaboration and validation.  

- **Scientific Progress**  
  - Builds on existing work and drives innovation.  
  - Encourages ongoing learning.  

## Best Practices 

1. **Maintain clarity and track your changes.**  

    - Comment code and list used packages.  
    - Helps others understand your process.  
    - Keeps a record of modifications for easy revision.  

2. **Avoid manual data manipulation.**  

    - Use tools like Git to track changes.
    - Keep different dataset versions.  
    - Tracks changes and makes transformations clearer.  

3. **Control randomness for consistency.**  

    - Set a random seed to ensure consistent results.  
    - Control confounding variables.
    - Ensures model changes are deliberate.  

4. **Make your work easy to understand.** 

    - Present findings clearly for stakeholders.  
    - Helps others replicate and understand your process.  

5. **Always credit the original sources.**  

    - Use formats like APA to cite sources.  
    - Ensures proper referencing and easy access.
