## Overview

Before creating slides, it’s important to plan your presentation. Consider your goal, the audience, and the message you want to deliver. 

## Planning the Presentation

- **Define the Purpose**  
  - Is your presentation informative, instructional, or persuasive?  
  - Example: 
    - Explain how sentiment analysis was done
    - Convince stakeholders to act on negative ratings.

- **Know Your Audience**  
  - Consider who you’re presenting to: 
    - Technical colleagues
    - Managers
    - Customers
  - Think about the size of the audience: 
    - Small meeting 
    - Large conference

- **Craft Your Message**  
  - Decide what key takeaway you want your audience to remember.  
  - Build your presentation to emphasize this message.
  - Example: "Negative ratings are hurting our sales."  

- **Structure the Presentation**  
  - Start with an engaging introduction.  
  - Dive into methods and findings
  - Tailor results to your audience’s understanding.  
  - Conclude with a call to action.

- **Outline Key Sections**  
  - Limit your presentation to about five sections.  
  - Example: Reason for analysis, exploratory analysis, sentiment analysis, conclusions, follow-up actions.

- **Keep Timing in Mind**  
  - Plan the presentation to fit within your allotted time.  
  - Adjust the content based on how long you have to speak.

## Designing the Slides 

Keep the slides simple, focused, and easy to follow for the audience.

- **Keep Slides Focused**  
  - Limit each slide to one main point.  
  - Too much content on a slide can overwhelm the audience.

- **Use a Clear Message**  
  - Every slide should convey one message clearly.  
  - Don't overload with confusing information.

- **Choose Colors Carefully**  
  - Use colors that support your message and ensure good contrast.  
  - Avoid red and green together for colorblind viewers.

- **Select Fonts Wisely**  
  - Sans-serif fonts are best for screens
  - Serif fonts are better for printed text.  
  - Keep text large and concise to enhance readability.

- **Avoid Text Overload**  
  - Don’t crowd slides with text.  
  - Use bullet points to highlight key ideas.

- **Use Headlines Effectively**  
  - Make your slide headlines clear and easy to understand.  
  - It guides your audience’s attention to the main point.

- **Layer Content for Clarity**  
  - Break complex information into smaller, digestible pieces.  
  - Reveal points separately, then combine to show the full picture.

- **Incorporate Visuals**  
  - Use graphs or visuals to replace text.  
  - Layer and highlight visuals to help focus audience’s attention.

- **Limit Visuals per Slide**  
  - Avoid overcrowding slides with multiple visuals.  
  - Stick to one or two large visuals per slide.


## Deliver the Presentation

When it's time to present, the way you deliver your message is just as important as the content itself.

- **Practice your presentation**  
  - Rehearse using a script as a guide.  
  - Focus on the key points, not memorization.  
  - Anticipate potential follow-up questions.

- **Rehearse in context**  
  - Stand up, use the slides, and speak aloud.  
  - Identify filler words like “um” or “so.”

- **Stay confident**  
  - Confidence makes your message more convincing.  
  - Avoid showing signs of nervousness.

- **Engage the audience**  
  - Make eye contact.  
  - Ask questions to keep them involved.
  - Talk *to* audience, not *at* them.

- **Keep it on time**  
  - Stick to allotted time to maintain attention.

- **Use pauses effectively**  
  - Let your audience absorb key points.  
  - Speed up for urgency, but pause to allow reflection.

- **Encourage questions**  
  - Invite questions during or at the end of the presentation.  
  - Show openness and willingness to clarify.
