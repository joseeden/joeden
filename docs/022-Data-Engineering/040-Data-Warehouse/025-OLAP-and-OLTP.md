## OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)  

OLAP systems help analyze large amounts of data quickly by organizing it into multiple dimensions.  

- Optimized for analysis, not transactions  
- Converts two-dimensional data into a multidimensional format  
- Supports "slicing and dicing" to explore data from different angles  

Example:  
A company tracks sales data by **region, year, and product**. OLAP allows analysts to break down total sales for each dimension and drill into specific details.  

### OLAP Cube  

The OLAP cube is a **multidimensional database** that speeds up data analysis.  

- Each dimension represents a category (e.g., region, year, product)  
- Values (e.g., total sales) are stored at the intersections of dimensions  
- Supports quick aggregations and breakdowns of data  

Example:  

If a cube has three dimensions (**Time, Product, Store Location**), analysts can retrieve total sales for **Q1, Electronics, Store A** or compare sales trends across different quarters.

### Hypercubes

Hypercubes are **OLAP cubes with more than three dimensions**, allowing for even more complex data analysis.  

Example:  

A hypercube with four dimensions (**Time, Product, Store Location, Customer Age Group**) enables analysts to retrieve total sales for **Q1, Electronics, Store A, Age 25-34** or compare trends across different age groups.

## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)  

OLTP systems handle **fast, simple transactions** like updates and lookups.  

- Optimized for frequent, small transactions  
- Used for applications like banking, reservations, and retail sales  
- Typically affects only a few rows at a time  

Example:  

A retail system updates a customer's balance after each purchase. The OLTP system records the transaction **instantly** but does not perform complex analysis.  

## Example: Credit Card Company

A data engineer at a credit card company maintains an OLTP system to track customer purchases in real time. However, for analyzing **spending patterns**, his team uses an OLAP system that organizes purchases by **year, age group, and location**.  

- **OLAP** is for analyzing large datasets using a multidimensional approach.  
- **OLTP** is for fast, real-time transactions affecting small amounts of data.  

OLAP uses multidimensional data for complex queries, while OLTP relies on traditional database tables (rows and columns).
