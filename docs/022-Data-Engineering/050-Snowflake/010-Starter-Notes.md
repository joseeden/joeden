## Overview

Snowflake is a data warehousing platform used by companies for storing and analyzing large datasets.

- A place for storing data for analysis and reporting.
- Data is analyzed using SQL queries.

Snowflake is easy to use and doesnâ€™t require managing hardware or software manually.

- Start using Snowflake right after signing up.
- No setup needed, Snowflake handles infrastructure.

## Features

Snowflake has several features to streamline data storage, transformation, and analysis.

- **Data Lake integration**: Connect with cloud storage services like AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- **Data pipelines**: Organize, clean, and apply rules to data.
- **Data privacy**: Ensures "least-privilege access" to sensitive data.

## Snowflake's Data Architecture

Snowflake's architecture has three main layers for processing and storing large datasets.

- **Cloud Services**: Manages access, optimizes queries, and tracks usage.
- **Query Processing**: Uses virtual warehouses and MPP to process queries.
- **Database Storage**: Compresses and stores data in a columnar format.
