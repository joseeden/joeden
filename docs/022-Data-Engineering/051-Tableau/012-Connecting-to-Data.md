## Overview 

Before creating visualizations in Tableau, you need to connect to a data source. Tableau supports many data sources, depending on the version you are using:

- **Tableau Public** – Works with limited sources like CSV  
- **Tableau Desktop** – Supports databases, cloud data, and more  

## Connecting to a CSV File  

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files store data in a simple format. To connect a CSV file in Tableau:  

- Click **Text File**  
- Select the CSV file (e.g., `airbnb_listings.csv`)  
- Tableau loads the data for preview  

## Exploring the Data  

Once loaded, you can:  

- **Rename columns** – Double-click a column name to edit  
- **Check data types** – Icons indicate numbers, text, or locations  
- **Change data types** – Click the icon to adjust if needed  

## Opening a Workbook

Tableau saves workbooks in different formats depending on the version and data storage needs. Two common file formats are **Tableau Workbook (.twb)** and **Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx).** 

1. On your computer, locate the workbook and double-click.
2. Another way to open a file is to click File > Open > Select the Workbook.
