## Overview

When creating a graph, it's important to focus on clarity and readability. 

## Formatting a Graph

Here's an example of a poorly formatted graph:

<div class="img-center"> 

![](/img/docs/Screenshot-2025-03-09-215718.png)

</div>

- Unclear title
- No legend
- Small font size
- Missing axis titles

By improving these elements, the graph becomes much clearer.

<div class="img-center"> 

![](/img/docs/Screenshot-2025-03-09-215827.png)

</div>

Changes made:

- Replaced one line with a bar chart to show global sales separately.
- Added a clear title and increased the font size for better readability.
- Labeled the axes and included a legend for easy interpretation.
- The graph now shows video game sales by release year and region, with 2008 being the highest-selling year.

## Formatting Tips

To improve your visualizations, use these techniques:

- **Informative titles**: Clearly explain what the graph shows.
- **Legible fonts and colors**: Make sure the text is large enough and the colors are easy to distinguish.
- **Legends**: Help viewers understand what different colors represent.
- **Axes titles**: Label your axes to make them clear.
- **Tooltips**: Add tooltips so users can learn more by hovering over the graph.

Tableau provides default formatting options that are easy to adjust if needed.

## Workbook vs. Sheet Formatting

You can format both at the workbook and sheet level. 

- **Workbook** 

  - This is like an entire Excel file. 
  - It contains multiple sheets.
  - Used to organize, save, share, and publish results.

- **Sheet** 

  - A single tab in the workbook, similar to an Excel tab. 
  - There are three types of sheets: 

    - Worksheets (used for creating visualizations)
    - Dashboards
    - Stories

## Example: Dual-Axis Graph 

In this example, we have a dataset that tracks video game sales from 1980 to 2010. We'll use it to compare global and European sales of Atari over time.  

<div class="img-center">

</div>

**Steps:**  

1. Set `Release Year` as the column and `Global Sales` as the row.  
2. Drag `EU Sales` to the right until a dotted line appears.  
3. Right-click and select **Synchronize Axis**.  
4. Ensure both axes have aligned numbers.  
5. Right-click the right axis and uncheck **Show Header**.  
6. Change `Global Sales` from **Line** to **Bar** chart in the **Marks** card.  
7. Center the title.  
8. Rename the Y-axis to **"Video Game Sales (in millions)"**.  
9. Drag `Publisher` to **Filters** and select **Atari** only.  

**Insights:**  

The graph shows Atariâ€™s peak sales in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp decline, leading to bankruptcy in 2013.
