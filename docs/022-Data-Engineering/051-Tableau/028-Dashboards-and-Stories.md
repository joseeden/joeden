## Dashboards  

Dashboards combine multiple views into one interactive display. They help compare data and reveal insights.  

- Automatically updates when worksheets change  
- Allows filtering and interactive analysis  
- Can connect views to act as filters  

## Dashboard Example  

A dashboard on video game sales can show:  

- Sales by platform  
- Top video games  
- Most popular genres

## Stories  

Stories organize key insights into a sequence of visualizations, which makes it easier to understand trends.  

- Helps present data as a narrative  
- Bookmarks important findings  
- Each step in a story is called a **story point**  

## Stories Example  

A video game sales story might include:  

- **Platform Comparison** – Compare Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo sales

## How Everything Fits  

Think of worksheets, dashboards, and stories like Russian dolls.  

- **Worksheets** go into **dashboards**  
- **Dashboards** go into **stories**  
- Sometimes, worksheets can go straight into a story  

This structure keeps insights organized and easy to explore.
