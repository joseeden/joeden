## Overview

Tableau makes it easy to turn data into interactive charts and graphs.  

- **Drag and Drop** – Move fields onto the canvas to create visuals  
- **Choose Chart Types** – Select bar charts, line graphs, maps, and more  
- **Customize** – Adjust colors, labels, and tooltips for better insights  

## Choosing Charts

In the example below, we have a workbook that's already loaded. Clicking the **Show me** button at the top right will display the visualizations options. When you select the a chart, the fields in the **Pages** shelf will disappear and a new shelf containing the color legends will appear on the right.

1. You can also select other charts such as a pie chart, box plots, etc.
2. For box plots, you can view values such as median by hovering over the plots.
3. For box plots, the box that appears when you hover over the plots is called **tooltips**
4. To print the actual values without hovering over, click the **Show Mark Labels** button.
