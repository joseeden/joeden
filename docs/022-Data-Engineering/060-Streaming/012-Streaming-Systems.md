## Real-Time

Real-time means completing tasks within a guaranteed timeframe based on the process requirements.

- Response happens within a set period
- The timeframe can vary: *seconds*, *minutes*, *hours*, or longer
- Guarantees are part of the system design

## Real-Time and Streaming

Real-time concepts are closely linked to streaming data.

- **Resource-dependent**

  - Speed depends on available computing and network resources
  - Limits how fast data can be processed and delivered
  - Data storage affects overall system efficiency

- **Continuous flow**

  - Streaming handles data as it arrives
  - Processing speed determines how “real-time” the system feels
