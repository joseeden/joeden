## Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, evolving from a bold idea into a powerful technology shaping many industries today.

- 1950s: AI was the science of building intelligent machines.
- Defined as "creating machines that can learn and reason."
- Mimics human intelligence but specializes in specific tasks

Modern AI focuses on learning, reasoning, and problem-solving to assist humans in complex tasks.


## Types of AI

AI can be categorized based on capabilities and scope.

- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**

  - Specialized in specific tasks
  - Examples: Voice assistants, face recognition, recommendation engines

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**

  - Hypothetical AI matching human intelligence across tasks
  - Does not exist yet

- **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**

  - Would surpass human intelligence
  - Still theoretical


## AI in Practice

AI applications are transforming industries and daily life.

- Healthcare: Predicting diseases, assisting diagnosis
- Transportation: Self-driving cars, traffic optimization
- Entertainment: Personalized recommendations, generative content
- Business: Fraud detection, customer service automation

Even though AI has made great strides, it remains task-specific. True human-like intelligence is still a goal for the future.

## Establishing an AI Culture

By adopting AI, companies can make smarter decisions and better align with market and customer needs.

- AI helps gain a competitive advantage
- Reduces operational costs through automation and optimized workflows
- Improves customer experience by personalizing interactions
- Supports revenue growth and employee productivity

## Building an AI-Driven Organization

To successfully implement AI, organizations need key building blocks across strategy, technology, and people. A strong AI culture combines these elements to create sustainable business value while maintaining ethical and responsible practices.
