## Overview

Itâ€™s important to know if an AI system is actually successful. Success means both reaching business goals and showing measurable performance improvements.

- Defines if goals are achieved
- Monitors performance before and after deployment
- Ensures return on investment is positive

By tracking results carefully, we confirm that AI creates real value and not just theoretical results.

## When to Measure Success

Measuring AI success is not a one-time activity.

- During development to check early performance
- After deployment in production
- Continuously through monitoring processes

This ongoing measurement makes sure AI stays effective over time.

## Measuring Performance Offline

Before deployment, models are tested with metrics to check how accurate and reliable they are.

1. **Training Stage**

   - Example: Classify penguin species using labeled data
   - We use part of the dataset to train the model
   - earn patterns that separate one species from another

2. **Validation Stage**

   - The remaining data is set aside for validation.
   - The model predicts species for these unseen penguins
   - We compare its predictions with the true labels.
   - Some predictions will be correct, others wrong.

In short, accuracy measures how often the model gets the answer right on new data. This gives a clear picture of its performance before moving to production.

## Beyond Accuracy

Depending on the problem and type of solution, there are other important metrics to monitor.

- Regression models focus on prediction error
- Recommendation systems measure ranking and relevance
- Search engines may look at user diversity and satisfaction

If performance is poor, the solution may need better data, fine-tuning, or adjustments. Metrics guide improvements to reach acceptable performance.

## Measuring Success in Production

Once deployed, models must still be monitored.

- Watch performance metrics over time
- Align results with business KPIs
- Detect **model degradation** when data changes

Model degradation occurs when real-world data no longer matches the data used for training. For example, if the type of incoming data changes, the model may need to be retrained.

**Key Performance Indicators** help connect AI performance to actual business success, making the system more valuable in the long term.

## Risks in AI Systems

AI projects carry risks that must be managed.

- Data bias causing unfair results
- Lack of transparency in decisions
- Ethical issues with data usage
- System reliability and robustness
- Vulnerability to security threats

A good way to reduce risk is starting with a Proof-of-Concept. This pilot version tests feasibility and potential before full deployment.
