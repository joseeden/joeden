## A Standard Workflow

For example, when summarizing a complex 30-page project document, the traditional workflow involves manually extracting key findings and proofreading. This process is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

With ChatGPT, we can automate parts of this process. By asking ChatGPT to summarize the document, we only need to proofread the summary, saving time and allowing focus on more creative tasks.
