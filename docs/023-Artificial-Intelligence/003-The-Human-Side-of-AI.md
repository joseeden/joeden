## AI democratization

AI is changing how we live and work. The goal is to make its benefits accessible to everyone.

- Makes AI tools usable without deep technical skills
- Supports daily tasks and decision-making
- Focuses on helping, not replacing, people

The idea of AI democratization is about giving everyone fair access to AI so it becomes a tool for empowerment, not a barrier.

## AI literacy

To make AI truly democratic, people need to understand it. This is where AI literacy comes in.

- Teaches basic AI concepts
- Builds awareness of technologies
- Explains impacts on society, business, and the environment


## AI Literacy supports AI Democratization

AI literacy strengthens AI democratization by preparing people to engage with AI thoughtfully.

- Builds skills to work with AI tools
- Promotes awareness of ethical issues like fairness and privacy
- Encourages inclusivity so more people can join the AI conversation
- Develops critical thinking to evaluate AI outputs and their effects

Together, AI literacy and democratization ensure that AI is used wisely and benefits all.

## Data Democratization in Organizations

Data democratization helps companies grow by giving more people access to information.

- Makes data available across teams
- Improves decision-making and strategies
- Requires upskilling staff to use data responsibly

When data is shared and understood, organizations can respond faster and gain an edge in the market.

## Data Democratization in Society

At a larger scale, data democratization empowers communities by breaking down barriers.

- Promotes open data policies
- Encourages transparent sharing practices
- Provides easy-to-use tools for data visualization
- Builds data literacy for broader understanding
