## Overview 

MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a framework for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production environments.  

- **Core Principles**:  
  - Focuses on continuous development and improvement of ML models.  
  - Inspired by DevOps, applying similar workflows to ML model lifecycle management.  

- **Processes**:  
  - Models are developed and tested in isolated environments before production deployment.  
  - Monitoring ensures accuracy, triggering retraining when necessary.  

- **Collaboration**:  
  - Involves data scientists, data engineers, and IT teams working together on deployed models.  

## Implementing MLOps on Kubernetes

The MLOps paradigm aligns well with Kubernetes due to its architecture and capabilities.  

- Isolated experimental systems are created using Kubernetes Pods and Storage.  
- ML models are monitored via Pod lifecycles and deployed images.  
- Teams can synchronously improve model accuracy using Kubernetes-based workflows.  

**Frameworks**:  

- mlflow
- Kubeflow

### Kubeflow 
Kubeflow simplifies
 the deployment and management of ML workflows on Kubernetes.  

- Supports all steps of the ML model lifecycle: data gathering, wrangling, training, testing, and deployment.  
- Independent components enable flexibility and allow for custom workflows.  
- Python integration allows direct interaction with the Kubernetes API without requiring `kubectl`.
