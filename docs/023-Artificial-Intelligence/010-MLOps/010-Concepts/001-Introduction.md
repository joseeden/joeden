## Overview

MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a framework for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production environments.

- **For real-world use**  
  - Models are part of business processes, not just local experiments.  
  - Focuses on deployment, not just training.  

- **Covers the full process**  
  - Includes design, development, deployment, and maintenance.  
  - Ensures models stay accurate and reliable.

## Origin of MLOps  

MLOps comes from DevOps, which improves software development.  

- **Based on DevOps**  
  - DevOps automates coding, testing, and deployment.  
  - Improves software reliability and speed.  

- **Applied to ML**  
  - Data scientists and ML engineers collaborate.  
  - Streamlines model deployment and monitoring.  

## Why MLOps Matters  

Building a machine learning model is just one part of the process.

- **Data preparation**   
  - Ensures high-quality, clean data for training.  
  - Uses feature engineering to create useful inputs.  

- **Performance analysis**
  - Analyzes performance before deployment.  
  - Detects issues early to improve accuracy.  

- **Continuous monitoring**    
  - Tracks model performance over time.  
  - Adjusts models to maintain reliability.
