## MLOps on Kubernetes  

Kubernetes supports MLOps with its scalable and flexible design.  

- **Isolated environments**  
  - Uses Pods and Storage for experiments.  
  - Keeps ML workflows separate and organized.  

- **Model deployment & monitoring**  
  - Tracks models through Pod lifecycles.  
  - Manages updates with container images.  

- **Collaborative workflows**  
  - Enables teams to improve models together.  
  - Automates tasks with Kubernetes-based pipelines.  

**Popular frameworks:**  

- **MLflow** – Tracks and manages ML experiments.  
- **Kubeflow** – Simplifies ML deployment on Kubernetes.  

## Kubeflow  

Kubeflow makes running ML models on Kubernetes easier.  

- **Supports the full ML lifecycle**  
  - Handles data processing, training, and deployment.  
  - Automates model testing and scaling.  

- **Flexible components**  
  - Allows custom workflows for different needs.  
  - Works with various ML tools and frameworks.  

- **Python integration**  
  - Interacts with Kubernetes without `kubectl`.  
  - Simplifies automation and scripting.
