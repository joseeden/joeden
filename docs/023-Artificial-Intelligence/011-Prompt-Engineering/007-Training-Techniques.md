## Overview

Training techniques shape how ChatGPT generates answers. Understanding zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning helps you guide the model effectively. These methods vary in the amount of context or examples provided before the main query.

## Techniques 


These are different ways to guide a model in understanding and answering tasks.

- **Zero-shot Learning**

  - No examples are given before the task
  - The model relies on prior training to answer new questions
  - Example: “Write a poem about the tranquility of mountains.”

- **One-shot Learning**

  - One example is given before the question
  - Helps the model learn from a single pattern
  - Example: “Mexico City is the capital of Mexico. What is the capital of Vatican City?”

- **Few-shot Learning**

  - Several examples are shown before the task
  - Helps the model understand context through multiple samples
  - Example: Asking for the capital of Malaysia while formatting with the country’s flag


## Pattern Matching and Recognition

Few-shot learning turns ChatGPT into a pattern-matching and pattern-generation engine:

- Writing style for emails, formatting preferences for reports, etc.
- Analyzes examples, mirrors patterns, generates new content.
- Extends ChatGPT's capability beyond simple responses to complex tasks.


## Chain of Thought (COT) Prompting

Chain of Thought Prompting (COT) provides a roadmap for answering:
- **Zero-shot COT**: Provide a scenario (e.g., traveling to space and encountering aliens) and prompt "think step by step."
  - **Result**: Thoughtful breakdown, revealing the model's reasoning.
- **One-shot COT**: Provide one example to teach the model the approach.
  - **Example**: Acknowledging the number of astronauts interacted with to prevent errors.

These techniques enhance how you interact with ChatGPT, making it a more effective tool.
