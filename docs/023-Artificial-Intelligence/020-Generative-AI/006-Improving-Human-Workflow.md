## Integrating Generative AI

Generative AI isn't a perfect fit for every workflow right away. We need to adapt user interfaces and how teams work to integrate AI effectively. Instead of seeing AI as a replacement, we can use it to enhance our work in various ways.

## Improving work

Generative AI can either assist in tasks or work alongside humans to create something together. 

- **Augmentation**

    - AI completes parts of a task.
    - Example: Creating a concept video for a human to edit.

- **Co-creation**

    - AI and humans collaborate, such as building a slide deck together.
    
- **Replacement**
    - AI can completely take over a task,
    - Like monitoring ocean temperatures and resolving issues.

Sometimes different parts of a job might be better suited to different styles of AI integration, such as AI suggesting edits for a novelist or generating social media posts.

## Integrating AI

To effectively integrate AI into workflows, there are a few steps to follow. 

1. **Identify opportunities**. Figure out where AI can help, then break down the process to see how it can be integrated. Find areas where AI can assist, like generating game objects in 3D development.

2. **Decompose the process**. Understand the workflow and where AI can fit in, such as using text-to-image tools for 2D concept art.

3. **Trial the AI solution**. Trial the AI with a small team to see if it's helpful.

4. **Implement it on a larger scale.** Trial the AI with a small team to see if it's helpful.


## Embracing a New Way of Working

Generative AI creates a new way of working. Instead of viewing AI as a competitor, see it as a partner that can generate ideas and handle routine tasks. 

- Keep learning about the latest AI trends in your field.
- Many AIs can teach and explain, helping you learn faster.
- It takes time and shared experiences to work effectively together.
