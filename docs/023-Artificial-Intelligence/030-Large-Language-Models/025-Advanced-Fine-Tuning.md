## Overview

Advanced fine-tuning is the last step in building large language models (LLMs). It brings together everything the model has learned to make it more accurate and aligned with human understanding.

- Combines what was learned from earlier stages
- Uses feedback to correct and refine behavior
- Makes responses more useful and natural

This process ensures that models not only generate text but also understand how to respond better based on human expectations.

## Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is the third phase of training after pre-training and fine-tuning. It helps the model learn from human guidance.

- Uses human feedback to adjust responses
- Improves relevance, tone, and accuracy
- Learns continuously through ranked examples

As a recap: 

- Pre-training teaches general language skills
- Fine-tuning focuses on specific tasks

Even after fine-tuning, models can produce incorrect or biased results because of noisy training data. RLHF helps fix that.

- Removes errors from general data
- Adds human validation to guide correct behavior
- Improves factual accuracy and tone

For example, a model trained on online data might mix facts with opinions. RLHF helps correct this by adding expert input.

## How RLHF Works

RLHF improves the model using human feedback in three main steps.

1. The model generates multiple possible responses
2. A human expert ranks these responses
3. The feedback trains the model to respond more like a person

Human reviewers help shape the model behavior by ranking the responses base on:

- Accuracy 
- Relevance 
- Coherence

Over time, this human-in-the-loop method helps the model develop more reliable and human-like communication.
