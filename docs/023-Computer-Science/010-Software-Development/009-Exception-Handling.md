## Importance of Error Handling 

Effective error handling is crucial for maintaining software security and preventing unexpected behavior that can lead to vulnerabilities. By anticipating and managing errors, developers can create more reliable applications.

## Key Points

- **Unexpected Behavior**
  - Software can fail when invalid input is processed.
  - Error handling prevents unpredictable states.
  
- **State Transitions**
  - Software should transition smoothly between defined states.
  - Errors can disrupt these transitions, leading to vulnerabilities.

- **Importance of Exception Handling**
  - Provides explicit instructions for error situations.
  - Helps maintain software integrity and security.

## Example of Exception Handling in Java

- **Try-Catch Structure**
  - Code is enclosed in a try block to attempt an operation.
  - A catch block captures specific exceptions, like division by zero.
  
- **User Feedback**
  - Reports errors back to the user for clarity.
  - Ensures the program can handle issues without crashing.
