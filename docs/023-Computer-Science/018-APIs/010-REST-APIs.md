## How API works

:::info[From freeCodeCamp on their definition of [what's an API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/):]

**APIs as a way to serve your customers**

**Example scenario:** Your small business’s website has a form used to sign clients up for appointments. You want to give your clients the ability to automatically create a Google calendar event with the details for that appointment.

**API use:** The idea is to have your website’s server talk directly to Google’s server with a request to create an event with the given details. Your server would then receive Google’s response, process it, and send back relevant information to the browser, such as a confirmation message to the user.

Alternatively, your browser can often send an API request directly to Google’s server bypassing your server.

## Representational State Transfer

:::info[From [Codecademy's site](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/REST-REpresentational-State-Transfer):]


REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.
