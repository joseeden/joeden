## Identity, Authentication, and Authorization

These three concepts are essential for securing applications and managing user access.

**Identity**: User data within the application.  
**Authentication**: Verifying the user's claimed identity.  
**Authorization**: Validating the user's permissions.

## Securing the Call

The simplest way to authenticate the API call is to use the built-in authentications method in your system.
