## Overview

A software development methodology, or Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model, consists of a framework of rules, steps, roles, and principles for software development. While many methodologies are available, the three most common are:

- Waterfall
- Agile
- Lean

Each methodology has its advantages and disadvantages. The choice of methodology depends on factors like project type, duration, and team size.


## Importance of Clear Requirements

Every software project should start with clear requirements. Developers and customers must work together to define these needs, which are essential for project success.

- Provide a shared understanding of project goals.
- Help prioritize critical features.
- Serve as a basis for testing and validation.

## Technical Design Process

After defining requirements, developers create a technical design that shows how different parts of the software will connect. This planning is vital, much like having a blueprint for a construction project.

- Outlines system architecture and data flow.
- Identifies interfaces between components.
- Facilitates better communication among team members.
- Reduces risks by identifying potential issues early.

## Waterfall Model

Once requirements are established, developers can begin building the software using different methodologies. One traditional method is the **Waterfall** model, which follows these steps:

1. Define system requirements
2. Create software requirements
3. Develop preliminary and detailed designs
4. Code and test the software
5. Move into operations and maintenance

This model is linear and can be inflexible, making it hard to adapt to changes during development.

Since each phase's outcome is crucial for the next, a single misstep can disrupt the entire process. If requirements change during an iteration, they cannot be addressed until the following cycle, potentially leading to increased costs and delays in delivering features to users.

## Spiral Model

Introduced in the 1980s, the Spiral Model improves on the Waterfall approach by using an iterative process with four main steps:

1. Set objectives and identify constraints
2. Evaluate options and manage risks
3. Develop and test the software
4. Plan for future work

In the Spiral mode, developers begin in the first phase and then move through each of the phases, multiple times, until they have a satisfactory finished product.

## Agile Method

The Agile method is favored for its adaptability and speed. Key Agile principles include:

- Valuing people and communication over strict processes
- Focusing on delivering functional software rather than heavy documentation
- Encouraging customer collaboration
- Being open to changing requirements

Agile promotes frequent delivery of working software, teamwork, and sustainable development. For more information, please see [What is Agile.](/docs/099-Project-Management/010-Introduction/001-Agile.md)

## Lean Software Development

Lean software development is based on Lean Manufacturing principles, which are focused on minimizing waste and maximizing value to the customer. There are seven principles for lean:

* Eliminate waste
* Amplify learning
* Decide as late as possible
* Deliver as fast as possible
* Empower the team
* Build integrity in
* Optimize the whole
