## Overview 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing many industries like medicine, marketing, HR, and art. This has driven a lot of investment in AI research and education. But how do AI and machine learning (ML) connect?

## Artificial Intelligence 

AI is a broad field focused on creating intelligent behavior in computers, with machine learning being a major part. While AI includes many areas like robotics, machine learning is the most common today. Machine learning uses data to make decisions and predictions.


## Machine Learning

Machine learning helps make sense of data and predict future events. It uses methods from statistics and computer science to allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

- **Inference**: Understanding causes, like "why it rains?"
- **Prediction**: Forecasting events, like "will it rain tomorrow?"

Machine learning identifies patterns in data and uses those patterns to make predictions. For example, it can analyze past emails to recognize spam and then spot new spam messages.

- Learns patterns from existing data
- Applies learned patterns to new data
- Requires high-quality data for success

## Machine Learning Models

Data science uses machine learning to find and communicate insights. Machine learning models represent real-world processes and help predict future events based on past data.

For example, a model might predict traffic based on past data or determine if a tweet is fake. By inputting new data, the model can give predictions and probabilities.
