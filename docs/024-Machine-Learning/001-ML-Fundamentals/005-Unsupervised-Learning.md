## Overview

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without needing a target column. It helps uncover structure, relationships, or anomalies in datasets.

- Learns patterns from data automatically
- Clustering, anomaly detection, and association.

## Clustering

Clustering groups similar observations together, making it easier to understand patterns or segments in the data.

- Animals grouped by breed or color
- Customer segments based on behavior

Below are some examples of clustering models: 

- **K-Means**

  - Number of clusters must be defined in advance
  - Groups points based on similarity or distance
  - Useful for organizing or segmenting data

- **DBSCAN**

  - Density-based clustering that can handle noise
  - Defines clusters based on point density
  - No need to specify number of clusters
  - Requires setting criteria for what counts as a cluster

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection focuses on identifying outliers, which are observations that significantly differ from others.

- **Detecting Outliers**

  - Highlights unusual patterns or errors that may need attention
  - Example: A data point far from a cluster of normal values

- **Removing Outliers**

  - Easier in low-dimensional data, harder in high-dimensional data
  - Algorithms help identify complex anomalies

- **Use Cases**

  - Fraud detection
  - Faulty device identification
  - Error spotting
  - Unusual medical cases

## Association

Association involves finding relationships between observations, often used in market basket analysis to determine which items are bought together.

- Finding events that happen together.
- Helps discover hidden relationships in data

It is commonly used in **market basket analysis** to find patterns in what items are purchased together.

- Jam is often bought with bread, beer with peanuts, wine with cheese
- Helps retailers plan product placement
- Reveals hidden product patterns
