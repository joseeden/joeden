## Overview 

The machine learning lifecycle consists of key stages that guide the development process. These stages are iterative, adapting as data and requirements change.  

- **Problem Understanding**  
  - Define the problem and set clear goals.  
  - Align with stakeholders on expectations.  
  - Identify key challenges and constraints.  

- **Data Collection and Preparation**  
  - Gather relevant data from reliable sources.  
  - Identify and address potential biases.  

- **Model Development/Training**  
  - Choose an appropriate ML algorithm.  
  - Train and fine-tune the model.  
  - Validate results with initial testing.  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Assess performance using relevant metrics.  
  - Compare with baseline models or benchmarks.  
  - Identify areas for improvement.  

- **Model Deployment**  
  - Prepare the model for real-world use.  
  - Integrate with existing systems or applications.  
  - Ensure scalability and performance.  

- **Model Monitoring**  
  - Track model performance over time.  
  - Detect and respond to performance degradation.  
  - Update or retrain the model as needed.  

## Defining User Requirements  

The model should meet user needs by providing accurate, reliable, and interpretable predictions.

- **Accuracy**  
  - The model should match or exceed expert-level performance.  
  - Avoid overfitting to training data.  

- **Generalization**  
  - The model must handle unseen data effectively.  
  - Test on diverse datasets to ensure robustness.  
  - Reduce dependency on specific training data patterns.  

- **Reliability**  
  - Ensure predictions are available when needed.  
  - Minimize latency for real-time applications.  
  - Implement fail-safes for unexpected inputs.  

- **Security**  
  - Protect sensitive data during training and use.  
  - Implement access controls and encryption.  
  - Regularly audit for potential vulnerabilities.  

- **Interpretability**  
  - Make the modelâ€™s decisions understandable.  
  - Allow human oversight and intervention when necessary.  

## Data Collection  

Collecting high-quality data is essential for building a reliable model.

- **Collecting Data**  
  - Obtain data from multiple reliable sources.  
  - Include diverse samples to prevent bias.  
  - Ensure consistency in data formats.  

- **Bias Consideration**  
  - Check for missing or underrepresented groups.  
  - Identify errors in self-reported data.  
  - Adjust for potential sampling bias.  

- **Data Understanding**  
  - Analyze patterns and distributions.  
  - Identify outliers and inconsistencies.  
  - Validate data accuracy before use.
