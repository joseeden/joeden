## Testing in Machine Learning  

Before deploying a model, testing ensures it works as expected and handles real-world scenarios correctly.  

- **Testing**  
  - Verifies that the model runs without errors  
  - Ensures predictions are accurate and fast  

- **Unit Tests**  
  - Detect errors before deployment  
  - Check specific parts of the model’s behavior  
  - Run automatically during development  

## Writing Unit Tests  

Python's `unittest` library helps define and run tests for models.  

To create a test case, we can first subclass `unittest.TestCase`, then add test methods that start with `test_`. Use assertions to check expected behavior. 

```python
import unittest

class TestModelInference(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.model = fitted_model
        self.X_test = X_test

    def test_prediction_output_shape(self):
        y_pred = self.model.predict(self.X_testt)
        self.assertEqual(y_pred.shape[0], self.X_test.shape[0])

if __name__  == '__main__'
    unittest.main()
```

We can also use other built-in methods like `assertIn()` to verify that input values fall within a valid range, ensuring data integrity.  

```python
def test_input_values(self):
    print("Running test_input_values test case")
    for row in X_test:  
        for value in row:
            self.assertIn(value, range(0, 501))  
```

## Key Considerations  

## Key Considerations  

Writing unit tests helps catch errors early and ensures models work as expected.   

- **Running Unit Tests**  
  - Run tests after every change  
  - Ensure new functionality is covered  

- **Avoiding Redundant Tests**  
  - Don’t test well-established library functions  
  - Focus on critical features  

- **Benefits of Testing**  
  - Prevents errors in production  
  - Increases confidence in model updates  

## Test-Driven Development  

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ensures code reliability by writing tests before implementation. 

- **Write Tests First**  
  - Define expected behavior before coding  
  - Guides development and prevents unexpected issues  

- **Iterate and Improve**  
  - Refactor code while keeping tests intact  
  - Ensures long-term stability and maintainability
