## Overview

MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a framework for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production environments.

- **For real-world use**  
  - Models are part of business processes, not just local experiments.  
  - Focuses on deployment, not just training.  

- **Covers the full process**  
  - Includes design, development, deployment, and maintenance.  
  - Ensures models stay accurate and reliable.

## Benefits of MLOps  

MLOps makes ML faster and more reliable.  

- **Improves teamwork**  
  - Bridges the gap between ML and operations teams.  
  - Enhances communication and collaboration.  

- **Automates deployment**  
  - Reduces manual work and errors.  
  - Speeds up model releases.  

- **Tracks performance**  
  - Detects performance drift and issues.  
  - Ensures models stay accurate in production.  

## Origin of MLOps  

MLOps comes from DevOps, which improves software development.  

- **Based on DevOps**  
  - DevOps automates coding, testing, and deployment.  
  - Improves software reliability and speed.  

- **Applied to ML**  
  - Data scientists and ML engineers collaborate.  
  - Streamlines model deployment and monitoring.  

## More Than Just Models 

Building a machine learning model is just one part of the process.

- **Data preparation**   
  - Ensures high-quality, clean data for training.  
  - Uses feature engineering to create useful inputs.  

- **Performance analysis**
  - Analyzes performance before deployment.  
  - Detects issues early to improve accuracy.  

- **Continuous monitoring**    
  - Tracks model performance over time.  
  - Adjusts models to maintain reliability.

## MLOps Lifecycle  

MLOps follows a structured process to turn machine learning ideas into real-world solutions.  

- Design: Define goals, assess data, and set success metrics.  
- Development: Train, test, and refine models.  
- Deployment: Integrate models, monitor performance, and update as needed.  

A structured lifecycle presents a clear roadmap which helps plan each stage of execution and ensures the right people and tools are involved at the right time.

### Design Phase  

This phase sets the foundation by defining goals and assessing feasibility.  

- **Define the Problem**  
  - Identify business needs and success criteria.  
  - Engage stakeholders to ensure project alignment.  

- **Prepare Data**  
  - Collect and clean high-quality data.  
  - Establish key metrics for evaluation.  

### Development Phase  

The model is built, tested, and improved.  

- **Experiment & Train**  
  - Test different algorithms and parameters.  
  - Train multiple models to compare performance.  

- **Refine & Optimize**  
  - Evaluate results and fine-tune the model.  
  - Ensure the model meets defined success criteria.  

### Deployment Phase  

The model is integrated into a live system and monitored.  

- **Deploy & Scale**  
  - Package the model as a microservice or API.  
  - Ensure smooth integration with existing systems.  

- **Monitor & Maintain**  
  - Track performance and detect issues like data drift.  
  - Update the model as needed to maintain accuracy.  

## Continuous Improvement  

MLOps is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.  

- **Evaluate Regularly**  
  - Assess if the model is still delivering value.  
  - Make adjustments based on real-world feedback.  

- **Iterate & Improve**  
  - Refine models using new data and better techniques.  
  - Adapt strategies to meet evolving business needs.  

## Roles in MLOps

The ML lifecycle follows a structured process with different tasks handled by various roles. These roles fall into two categories: business and technical.  

### Business Roles  

Business roles focus on project goals, budget, and domain knowledge.  

- **Business Stakeholder**  
  - Oversees budget and project alignment with company goals.  
  - Defines business requirements and evaluates project success.  

- **Subject Matter Expert**  
  - Provides industry-specific knowledge.  
  - Helps interpret data and model results.  

### Technical Roles  

Technical roles handle data, model development, and deployment.  

- **Data Scientist**  
  - Analyzes data, trains models, and evaluates performance.  
  - Monitors deployed models to ensure accuracy.  

- **Data Engineer**  
  - Collects, stores, and processes data.  
  - Ensures data quality through validation and testing.  

- **ML Engineer**  
  - Works across all ML lifecycle stages.  
  - Manages data extraction, model training, and deployment.  

### Other Roles  

Additional contributors vary based on the project and company structure.  

- **Software Engineers & Backend Engineers**  
  - Assist with integrating models into applications.  

- **Data Analysts**  
  - Provide insights from data for better decision-making.  

- **Developers**  
  - Help with coding, automation, and infrastructure setup.  

Roles in startups may be more flexible, while enterprises typically have specialized teams.
