## Overview


MLOps follows a structured process to turn machine learning ideas into real-world solutions.  

- Design: Define goals, assess data, and set success metrics.  
- Development: Train, test, and refine models.  
- Deployment: Integrate models, monitor performance, and update as needed.  

A structured lifecycle presents a clear roadmap which helps plan each stage of execution and ensures the right people and tools are involved at the right time.

## Design Phase  

This phase sets the foundation by defining goals and assessing feasibility.  

- **Define the Problem**  
  - Identify business needs and success criteria.  
  - Engage stakeholders to ensure project alignment.  

- **Prepare Data**  
  - Collect and clean high-quality data.  
  - Establish key metrics for evaluation.  

## Development Phase  

The model is built, tested, and improved.  

- **Experiment & Train**  
  - Test different algorithms and parameters.  
  - Train multiple models to compare performance.  

- **Refine & Optimize**  
  - Evaluate results and fine-tune the model.  
  - Ensure the model meets defined success criteria.  

## Deployment Phase  

The model is integrated into a live system and monitored.  

- **Deploy & Scale**  
  - Package the model as a microservice or API.  
  - Ensure smooth integration with existing systems.  

- **Monitor & Maintain**  
  - Track performance and detect issues like data drift.  
  - Update the model as needed to maintain accuracy.  

## Continuous Improvement  

MLOps is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.  

- **Evaluate Regularly**  
  - Assess if the model is still delivering value.  
  - Make adjustments based on real-world feedback.  

- **Iterate & Improve**  
  - Refine models using new data and better techniques.  
  - Adapt strategies to meet evolving business needs.
