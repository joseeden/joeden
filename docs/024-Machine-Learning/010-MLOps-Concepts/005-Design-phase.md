## Overview

The design phase defines the project's goals, impact, and key performance metrics.  

## Added Value  

Before building a model, it's important to estimate its potential value.  

- Ensures resources are used efficiently.  
- Reduces uncertainty in ML projects.  
- Supports responsible deployment.

## Business Requirements  

A machine learning model must meet business needs beyond just accuracy.  

- **Prediction needs**  
  - Frequency of predictions (e.g., daily, hourly).  
  - Speed of predictions (e.g., real-time or batch).  

- **Transparency & explainability**  
  - Important for understanding errors and improving models.  
  - Some industries require explanations for decisions.  

- **Regulatory compliance**  
  - Example: Financial models must provide decision explanations.  

- **Budget & team size**  
  - Determines project feasibility and complexity.  

## Key Metrics  

Aligning these metrics ensures that all stakeholders understand and support the ML project.

From different perspectives:

- **Data Scientist**  

  - Focuses on accuracy and correctness.  
  - Example: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression models.  

- **Subject Matter Expert**  

  - Looks at business impact, like improved workflow.  
  - Example: A hospital model reducing patient wait times.  

- **Business Stakeholder**  

  - Measures financial impact (profit, cost savings).  
  - Example: Increased sales due to better demand forecasting.
