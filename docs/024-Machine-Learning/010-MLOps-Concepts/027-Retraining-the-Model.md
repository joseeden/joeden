## Overview 

Retraining is essential to keep the model updated and accurate as data changes over time.

- **Changes in data over time**  
  - Data naturally changes, affecting model accuracy.  
  - Refreshing data helps adjust the model to new patterns.

- **Drift in data**  
  - Changes in data or relationships can affect model predictions.

## Types of Drift  

There are two main types of drifts:

- **Data drift**  
  - Change in the input data (e.g., new customer demographics).  
  - May affect performance, but not always.

- **Concept drift**  
  - Change in how input data relates to the target variable.  
  - Can reduce model accuracy if patterns change.

## How Often to Retrain?  

Retraining frequency depends on multiple factors.

- **Business environment**  
  - Fast-changing industries need more frequent retraining.
  - Market condition changess may need quicker adjustments.

- **Cost of retraining**  
  - Requires resources and money, especially for complex models.
  - High costs need to be weighed against model performance gains.

- **Business requirements**  
  - High accuracy standards may necessitate more frequent updates.
  - If performance drops below thresholds, retraining is needed.


## Retraining Methods  

When retraining, you can choose how to update the model.

- **Separate model for new data**  
  - Train a new model only on the latest data.
  - Good for handling shifting data but may miss older trends.

- **Combine new and old data**  
  - Merge both data sets to create a new model.
  - Maintain context with past data while adapting to changes.

## Automatic Retraining  

Retraining can be automated based on drift detection.

- Set thresholds for data or concept drift to trigger retraining.  
- Reduces manual intervention by adjusting the model when needed.  
- Useful in systems with frequent updates and fast-changing environments.
