## Overview 

MLOps maturity measures automation, collaboration, and monitoring in machine learning processes. It shows areas where improvements can be made.

- MLOps maturity improves process efficiency.
- Design phase can't be fully automated, but templates can help.

## Levels of MLOps Maturity  

MLOps maturity is divided into three levels, each with different automation and collaboration.

- **Level 1: Manual processes**  
  - No automation; teams work separately.  
  - Development and deployment are done manually.  
  - Minimal tracking of features or performance.  
  - Slow development and deployment, especially when issues arise.

- **Level 2: Automated development**  
  - There's some collaboration between teams.
  - Some automation in development (e.g., feature stores, training).  
  - Models are developed automatically, but deployment is still manual.  
  - Traceability during development, monitoring after deployment.

- **Level 3: Automated development and deployment**  
  - Close collaboration between teams.
  - Full automation for both development and deployment.  
  - CI/CD pipelines for development, testing, and deployment.
  - Models are actively monitored in production.  
  - Models may retrain automatically when needed.
