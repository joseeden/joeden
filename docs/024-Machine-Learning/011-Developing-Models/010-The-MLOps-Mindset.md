## Overview

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) helps teams manage ML models in production. It ensures smooth deployment, monitoring, and scaling.  

- **Collaboration** between data scientists and operations teams  
- **Testing** models before deployment  
- **Scaling** to handle production workloads  

By following MLOps practices, models stay reliable and efficient.  

## ML Experiments  

ML experiments test different models to find the best one.  

- **Train** models on various datasets  
- **Evaluate** accuracy and reliability  
- **Select** the best-performing model  

This process is key to improving machine learning projects.  

## From Experiments to Production  

A model moves to production when it is tested and validated.  

- **Document** the model and its parameters  
- **Test** with different datasets  
- **Monitor** performance in real-world settings  

Once validated, it should be deployed in a secure, scalable environment.

## Why Most ML Experiments Fail  

Many ML experiments donâ€™t reach production due to common issues.  

- **Unclear goals** make success hard to measure  
- **Poor data quality** leads to unreliable results  
- **Overly complex models** are hard to deploy  
- **Overfitting/underfitting** affects accuracy  

Addressing these problems improves success rates.  

## Technical Debt  

Technical debt happens when rushed code causes future issues.  

- **Unvalidated code** leads to bugs  
- **Outdated documentation** makes debugging harder  
- **Quick fixes** cause long-term problems  

Prioritizing quality and proper testing prevents technical debt.  

### Example of Poor vs. Good Code  

**Poor Code (No Validation, Hard to Maintain)**  

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
data["label"] = data["label"].map(lambda x: 1 if x == "spam" else 0)
```

**Good Code (Handles Errors, Clear Logic)**  

```python
import pandas as pd

def load_data(filepath):
    try:
        data = pd.read_csv(filepath)
        data["label"] = data["label"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "spam" else 0)
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading data: {e}")
        return None

df = load_data("dataset.csv")
```

Taking time to write clean, well-tested code prevents future issues.
