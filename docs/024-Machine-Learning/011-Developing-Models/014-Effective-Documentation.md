## Overview

Good documentation makes machine learning projects easier to use, understand, and improve. It helps track data, models, and decisions for future reference.  

## Key Documentation Areas  

ML documentation should cover six main areas:  

- **Data sources** – Where the data comes from and how to access it  
- **Data schemas** – Structure and organization of data  
- **Labeling methods** – How data is labeled for training  
- **Model pseudocode** – Steps involved in building and running the model  
- **Model experiments** – Testing, selection, and hyperparameters  
- **Training environments** – Software and settings used for training  

## Data Sources  

Tracking data sources ensures quality control and long-term access.  

- Helps compare different datasets  
- Identifies inconsistencies or errors  
- Makes it easier to update or replace data  

## Data Schemas  

Data schemas describe the structure of datasets to maintain consistency.  

- Defines fields, types, and relationships  
- Helps organize unstructured data  
- Ensures models learn from properly formatted inputs  

Example schema in JSON format:  

| Field Name       | Data Type  | Data Order  | Description                         |  
|-----------------|------------|------------|-------------------------------------|  
| `customer_id`   | Integer    | Nominal    | Unique identifier for each customer |  
| `purchase_amount` | Float      | Ordinal    | Amount spent in the transaction    |  
| `purchase_date`  | Datetime   | Ordinal    | Date and time of the purchase      |  

Where: 

- **Nominal**: Categories without inherent order (e.g., customer IDs)  
- **Ordinal**: Data with a meaningful sequence (e.g., dates, amounts)

## Labeling Methods  

For classification tasks, clear labeling methods improve accuracy and reproducibility.  

- Explains how data is categorized  
- Tracks label changes over time  
- Helps refine labels for better model performance  

Example process:  

```plaintext
1. Raw images collected from website logs  
2. Labeled using pre-trained model + manual verification  
3. Labels reviewed and corrected by domain expert  
```

## Model Pseudocode  

Simplified steps outline the model’s structure and logic.  

- Helps understand data flow and transformations  
- Provides a reference for debugging  
- Acts as a blueprint for future improvements  

Example pseudocode:  

```python
1. Load dataset
2. Preprocess data
3. Split into training and test sets
4. Train model using logistic regression
5. Evaluate performance
6. Save trained model
```

## Model Experiments  

After collecting and labeling data, we document how we tested and chose our ML models. This helps track progress and allows others to improve the process.  

- **Model choices**: List tested architectures and selection criteria.  
- **Performance metrics**: Explain how the best model was chosen.  
- **Hyperparameters**: Record different settings tested during training.  


## Training Environments  

Along with model selection, we should document the training environment, as reproducibility depends on capturing the exact setup used.

- Lists dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)  
- Specifies hardware details (CPU, GPU, RAM)  
- Logs random seeds to ensure consistent results  

For example, changes in data processing or random seeds can impact model performance if not properly recorded.
