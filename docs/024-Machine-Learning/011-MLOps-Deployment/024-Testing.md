## Overview  

Testing ensures that all parts of the ML application work correctly, including database communication, authentication, and logging.  

## Unit Testing  

Unit tests checks individual functions or components. They should be reliable and independent of changing development environments.  

- Runs fast after small code changes  
- Focus on isolated units, no external dependencies  
- Runs in a test environment, keeps development stable  

Example: Function to test:

```bash
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Unit test:

```bash
import pytest  
from app import add_numbers  

def test_add_numbers():  
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5  
    assert add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0  
    assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0  

pytest.main()
```

Expected output:

```
3 passed in 0.01s
```

## Integration Testing  

Integration Testing ensures the different components work together.  

- **Tests API and database interactions** – Verifies real-world connections  
- **Uses a staging environment** – Matches production setup  
- **Includes smoke tests** – Ensures the app starts without errors  

The staging environment should replicate production as closely as possible, including database versions and representative data (partial copy of production data).

## Load and Stress Testing  

Checks system performance under different loads.  

- **Load testing** – Simulates expected usage  
- **Stress testing** – Pushes beyond normal limits  

These tests help identify system bottlenecks and improve stability.  

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)  

Final testing by real users.  

- **Verifies usability** – Ensures functionality meets expectations  
- **Approves for production** – Confirms system readiness  

Only after successful UAT should the application be deployed.  

## Testing Strategy  

Trying to test every possible edge case can be inefficient. Focus on the most critical parts of your application and prioritize testing them first.

- Prioritize critical components
- Focus on high-impact areas  
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
