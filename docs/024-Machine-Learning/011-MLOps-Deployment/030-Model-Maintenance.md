## Overview

When a model's performance declines, it's essential to take action to bring it back to acceptable levels. There are two main strategies: improving the model itself or improving the data used to train it.

## Improving the Model

Sometimes, the issue lies within the model itself, and adjustments are needed to improve its performance.

- Also called the **Model-centric Approach**
- Experiment with different models or combinations of models.
- Refine the features used by the model.
- Tune model parameters for better accuracy.

In competitions, improving the model is often the primary solution since datasets are fixed. However, in real-life scenarios, this might not be enough.

## Improving the Training Data

In many cases, enhancing the training data can have a greater impact than changing the model.

- Also called the **Data-centric Approach**
- Use tools to label data more accurately and efficiently.
- Consider human-in-the-loop systems where experts help label data.

Improving data quality can lead to better model performance, as the model learns from better examples. This approach has been shown to outperform model-centric changes in many real-world use cases.

## Tracking and Experimentation

Keeping track of experiments and model performance helps avoid wasting resources on repetitive tasks.

- Use tools like MLFlow to track experiments and models.
- Document model changes and their outcomes.
- Compare new models with previous versions to ensure improvements.

Experiment tracking ensures we don't repeat unsuccessful attempts. It's vital for maintaining a clear history of what works and what doesnâ€™t.
