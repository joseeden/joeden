## Overview  

Good code structure, versioning, and documentation make ML projects easier to manage and adapt.  

## Organizing ML Projects  

A clear project structure keeps files easy to find.  

- **Group related files** (data, models, scripts)  
- **Use clear names** for easy identification  
- **Separate concerns** (preprocessing, training, evaluation)  

This makes collaboration and debugging much simpler.

## Sample Project Structure  

A well-organized ML project follows a logical structure:  

```plaintext
ml_project/
│── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   ├── interim/
│── models/
│── notebooks/
│── src/
│   ├── preprocessing.py
│   ├── feature_engineering.py
│   ├── training.py
│── README.md
```

Where: 

- **data/** stores raw and processed datasets  
- **models/** contains trained models  
- **notebooks/** helps explore and visualize data  
- **src/** includes core scripts for ML tasks  
- **README.md** explains how to use the project  

## Tracking Code Changes  

Version control helps keep track of updates and fixes.  

- **Revert changes** if something breaks  
- **Find errors faster** by comparing old versions  
- **Work in parallel** with teammates easily  

Using Git for version control makes ML development more efficient.  

## Clear Documentation  

Good documentation helps others (and your future self) understand the project.  

- **Explain files and functions** (what they do and how to use them)  
- **Provide setup and deployment instructions**  
- **Keep comments in code** to describe important logic  

Here is an example of a well-documented function  :

```python
def clean_data(df):
    """
    Cleans input DataFrame by removing null values and duplicates.
    
    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The raw dataset.
    
    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The cleaned dataset.
    """
    df = df.dropna().drop_duplicates()
    return df
```

This makes it easier for anyone to understand and modify the function.  

## Keeping Code Adaptable  

Maintainable code is easy to update and expand.  

- **Well-structured code** is easier to modify  
- **Clear documentation** prevents confusion  
- **Scalability** helps handle changing data and requirements  

Clean, well-organized ML code allows projects to evolve smoothly over time.
