## Overview 

Reproducibility ensures that machine learning models produce consistent and reliable results. It allows others to replicate experiments, verify findings, and collaborate effectively.  

- Reduces bias and improves research integrity  
- Builds confidence in model accuracy  
- Supports collaboration and knowledge sharing  

## Using MLflow  

MLflow is an open-source tool for tracking and managing ML experiments. It helps log dependencies, code versions, and experiment settings, which makes it easy to reproduce ML workflows.  

- Tracks code, models, and metrics  
- Supports collaboration with shared experiment logs  
- Integrates with tools like scikit-learn

## Example: MLflow with Scikit-Learn  

MLflow makes tracking model training simple. Below is an example of using MLflow to log a `RandomForest` model.  

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Start MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log model and parameters
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)

    # Log metrics
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

print("Model logged with MLflow!")
```

MLflow logs the model, parameters, and accuracy, making it easy to track and compare runs.  

## Tracking Code with MLflow

MLflow helps track code versions and changes, and ensures experiments can be exactly reproduced.  

- Logs code used in experiments  
- Helps debug and troubleshoot issues  
- Identify version of code used to produce results
- Enables comparison of different model versions  

## Model Registry  

A model registry stores and manages different versions of ML models along with metadata.  

- Logs model versions and performance metrics  
- Allows easy rollback to previous models  
- Used for comparing models and repdocuing ML pipelines
- Ensures consistency in production deployments  

## Experiment Reproducibility  

MLflow logs key elements of an experiment:  

- Input data  
- Code and dependencies  
- Model settings and results  

This allows others to validate findings and replicate results reliably.  

## Importance of Documentation  

Clear documentation is essential for reproducibility.  

- Include input data, code, and settings  
- Keep records updated and accessible  
- Ensure others can understand and build upon your work  

By following these principles, ML experiments become reliable, transparent, and easy to reproduce.
