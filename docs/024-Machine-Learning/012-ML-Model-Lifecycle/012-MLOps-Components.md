## Integration with DevOps

MLOps automates the lifecycle of machine learning models, from development to deployment and monitoring. It builds on DevOps but adds machine learning workflows and data management.  

- Uses workflows, pipelines, and artifacts.  
- Includes ML-specific components (model registry, feature store, and metadata store.)

## Workflows  

Workflows are sequences of tasks that process inputs into outputs, which can be automated using pipelines.  

- **Manual workflows** – Require human intervention.  
- **Automated workflows** – Fully scripted for efficiency.  
- **Pipelines** – Automate workflows through structured scripts.  

After a pipeline runs, it returns an output known as an artifact.

## Artifacts   

Artifacts are the outputs of pipelines which essential for deployment.  

- Catch-all term for any output of the development process
- Include trained models, logs, and reports.  

## ML Pipelines 

Build pipelines convert raw code and data into deployable models. In MLOps, there are at least two separate build workflows:

- **Model build pipeline** – Trains and outputs a model.  
- **App build pipeline** – Packages the ML application that serves the model.  

## Build Pipeline

Also known as a **Model Training Pipeline**, the model build pipeline transforms raw data into a deployable model.

- **Features** – These are raw data or pre-processed data. 
- **Feature Store** – A database that stores features for model training.
- **Training Output** – After running, the model and its metadata are produced.

The pipeline results in a trained model and complementary data for deployment, called **model metadata**.

- **Model Registry** – Stores and versions trained models.
- **Metadata Store** – Stores model details for deployment and lifecycle management.

By organizing the model and metadata efficiently, teams can ensure smooth deployment and manage the entire lifecycle of the model.

## Deployment Pipeline

Once we have the models and app packages ready, the next step is deployment. This process involves moving the build artifacts to the target platform for serving.

- **Deployment Task** – Move the ML app and model packages to the serving platform.
- **Service Start** – Once deployed, start the service and monitor its performance.

After deployment, we can monitor the service to ensure it runs as expected and performs well.
