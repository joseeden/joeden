# Feature Store  

A feature store is a central place for storing and managing ML features.  

- Standardizes feature storage and access  
- Supports batch and real-time data  
- Prevents duplication across teams  

## Example  

A company has multiple ML teams working on different projects. Without a feature store, they manually extract, transform, and store similar features separately. A feature store centralizes this process, ensuring all teams use consistent, well-defined features.
