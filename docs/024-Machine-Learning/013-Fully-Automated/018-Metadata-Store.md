## Metadata   

Metadata stores information about machine learning (ML) experiments, models, and pipelines. It helps manage and monitor ML workflows efficiently.  

- Tracks data from creation to consumption
- Shows transformations and usage.  
- Logs experiment settings to ensure consistent results.  
- Keeps records of pipeline execution, helps detect issues early.  

## Aspects of Metadata  

Metadata helps track and manage ML experiments. Key aspects include:  

- **Data lineage**  
  - Tracks data from creation to consumption  
  - Shows transformations and usage  

- **Reproducibility**  
  - Logs experiment settings for consistent results  
  - Allows others to reproduce outcomes  
  - Increases trust in ML systems  
  - Includes hyperparameter settings  

- **Monitoring**  
  - Keeps records of pipeline execution  
  - Checks ML system status anytime  
  - Helps detect issues early  

## Metadata Store  

A **metadata store** keeps track of ML experiments but does not store models or data. It logs artifacts, execution details, and system events.  

- Works with all ML pipeline steps  
- Reads and writes logs automatically  
- Supports **auto incident response**  
- Detects **model drift**  
- Retrains models when performance drops  
- Triggers automatic rollbacks if needed  

With a metadata store, ML pipelines can track changes, automate monitoring, and maintain reliability in production.

## Automated Model Retraining  

A metadata store helps monitor models and trigger automatic updates to maintain performance. Hereâ€™s how it works:  

1. A fully automated MLOps system delivers predictions and is constantly monitored.  
2. Evaluation metrics are logged in the metadata store.  
3. If performance declines, the system detects model decay.  
4. The system triggers retraining and updates the model in the registry.  
5. The new model is deployed, updating the prediction service to handle drift.
