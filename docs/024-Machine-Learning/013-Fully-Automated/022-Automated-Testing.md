## Overview

Software testing ensures that an application works as expected. In ML, testing goes beyond traditional methods and adds more complexity due to the nature of data and model behavior.

## Types of Software Tests  

Different types of tests check the functionality of an application:

- **Unit Tests**  
  - Test individual components  
  - Ensure each part works as intended  

- **Integration Tests**  
  - Check how components interact  
  - Identify issues in the communication between parts  

- **End-to-End Tests**  
  - Test overall system functionality  
  - Ensure the application works from start to finish  

For more information, please see [Testing.](/docs/024-Machine-Learning/011-MLOps-Deployment/024-Testing.md)

## ML Systems Are Different  

ML systems depend on data and models, which makes them unique:

- **Data Dependency**  
  - Models rely on the quality of training data  
  - Data influences the modelâ€™s behavior  
  - Poor data can affect performance  

- **Model-Driven Behavior**  
  - Behavior is learned, not pre-programmed  
  - Models adapt over time based on data  
  - Stale models can degrade performance 
  - Models need regular updates 

Testing ML systems is more complex than traditional systems, as shown in the figure below:

## Types of Tests for ML Systems  

In addition to traditional softwarer tests, ML systems also require unique types of tests to ensure quality:

- **Data Tests**  
  - Verify feature values and distributions  
  - Check for compliance with privacy standards  

- **Model Tests**  
  - Monitor performance metrics  
  - Ensure accuracy and avoid overfitting  

- **Pipeline Tests**  
  - Ensure reproducibility of training results  
  - Verify end-to-end pipeline functionality
