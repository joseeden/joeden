## Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are values set before training that contorl the learning process. 

- Hyperparameters must be chosen carefully
- They significantly influence the model's accuracy.
- Cannot be learned from data during training

**Model parameters**, like weights and biases, are learned during training. **Hyperparameters**, on the other hand, must be set before training begins. Examples include:

- Model Architecture in a Neural Networ;
- Number of branches in a decision tree 
- Learning rate

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is used to improve the performance of machine learning models. 

- Adjusting hyperparameters to improve model performance
- Focus on factors like learning rate, number of layers, or tree depth
- Common starting point for model optimization

Tuning helps find the best combination of hyperparameters for the model.

## Hyperparameter Tuning Methods

Different methods offer distinct approaches to hyperparameter tuning.

- **Grid Search**
  - Tests all combinations from a predefined grid
  - Exhaustive but time-consuming

- **Random Search**
  - Randomly tests hyperparameter combinations
  - Faster than grid search but can miss optimal solutions

- **Bayesian Search**
  - Uses Bayesian optimization to refine hyperparameter selection
  - Efficient as it learns from past trials to guide future searches


## Automated Hyperparameter Tuning

Manually finding the best hyperparameter combination is time-consuming. Automating this process helps find the best set of hyperparameters efficiently.

- Saves time and effort
- Leads to better-performing models
- Ensures optimal hyperparameter selection

## Steps for Automated Tuning

These steps guide the automated tuning process to find the best model parameters.

1. Define hyperparameters to tune
2. Set search space (discrete values or ranges)
3. Choose a performance metric (e.g., recall, precision)
4. Set stopping criteria (e.g., maximum trials)

## Environment Symmetry

Consistent settings across environments lead to reliable model performance.

- Ensures model behaves consistently across environments
- Prevents unexpected behavior when deploying models

## Tracking Experiments

Automated tracking logs all tuning details to help manage experiments.

- Automate tracking of hyperparameter experiments
- Record all hyperparameter combinations explored
- Store metadata for later reference

## Hyperparameter Visualization

Visualization helps in interpreting the effects of hyperparameter changes.

- Understand the impacts of different hyperparameters
- Helps analyze performance variations with different values
