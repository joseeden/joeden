## ML Pipelines

ML pipelines are central to MLOps systems. They run in both development and production environments. They ensure a smooth flow from model creation to deployment.

- Allows quick iterations  
- Helps validate new algorithms  
- Run pipelines automatically  
- Triggered by specific events

ML pipelines help teams experiment with models in development and deploy them seamlessly in production.

## Modularity & Reusability  

ML pipelines are designed in a modular way, which allows independent changes to individual components without disrupting the entire system.

- Components are independent
- Allows focused updates  
- Easy to reuse across tasks

ML pipelines can be easily adapted to different tasks and data sets, making them highly reusable and efficient in MLOps systems.

## Orchestration & Automation  

Orchestration in MLOps refers to automating the flow of tasks within ML pipelines. This includes managing dependencies and executing tasks in sequence.

- Schedule and coordinate tasks  
- Ensures no task is missed  
- Monitor task execution  
- Provides alerts on errors

Orchestration streamlines the process, reduces manual errors, and ensures tasks are executed in the right order.

## Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)  

DAGs are graphical representations of the flow of tasks in an ML pipeline that shows dependencies between each step. 

- Makes complex workflows more understandable
- Helps maintain reproducibility  
- Each step is a *node*, and relationships as *edges*

DAGs controls task execution order, making it easier to manage and track tasks.

## Orchestration in ML Environments

### Development & Experimentation  

In development environments, orchestration helps manage the end-to-end flow of tasks, such as training models and evaluating results.

- Ensures all steps are executed  
- Keeps results organized  
- Run experiments in parallel  
- Reduces experimentation time  

### Production  

Orchestration automates the deployment process in production and ensures that ML models are consistently and reliably updated.

- Reduces manual intervention  
- Ensures models are up-to-date  
- Manage deployment steps  

Pipeline Oochestration in production provides centralized monitoring which simplifies troubleshooting and resolving issues.
