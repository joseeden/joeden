## Overview

DevOps focuses on collaboration between developers and IT operations to improve the software development process.

- Combines software development and IT operations  
- Enhances communication, optimizing delivery speed

These DevOps practices, including automation, extend to machine learning (ML) applications, creating MLOps for ML development and deployment.

- Automates ML model training and deployment  
- Enables faster, more efficient model management



## Decaying Performance

ML model performance degrades over time due to changes in data. **Constant training (CT)** helps keep models updated.

- Models retrained regularly  
- Ensures models remain accurate  
- Adapts to new data patterns

CT helps maintain model effectiveness by continuously retraining models as new data becomes available.

## CI/CD/CT/CM in MLOps  

CI/CD and ML-specific tests form the backbone of an automated MLOps system, enabling smooth integration and deployment.

- CI/CD ensures seamless updates  
- Integrates code and fixes into production  
- ML-specific tests included in CI  
- Checks model accuracy and validates performance

CI/CD/CT/CM integrates the ML lifecycle, ensuring that models remain up-to-date and high-performing.

## CI/CD 

**Continuous integration (CI)** and **continuous deployment (CD)** help improve software quality and speed up delivery.

- Integrates code from multiple developers  
- Runs automated tests on each commit  
- Deploys automatically after successful tests

## Continuous Training (CT)

Continuous training (CT) allows models to stay accurate and effective as new data is added.

- Retrains models regularly  
- Adapts to new data  
- Ensures up-to-date performance

## Continuous Monitoring (CM)

Continuous monitoring (CM) helps track model and data quality to ensure everything works as expected.

- Monitors data and model performance  
  - Detects issues like data drift  
  - Triggers fixes when needed

CM ensures that issues like data drift or model performance degradation are quickly identified and addressed.

## Automation First  

A focus on automation throughout the ML lifecycle ensures models are updated quickly and easily.

- Automates model updates  
- Simplifies maintenance  
- Speeds up model deployment

## Automated Incident Response  

An automated response pattern addresses issues that arise in ML systems and ensures minimal disruption.

- Detects system issues automatically  
- Reduces manual intervention  
- Improves system reliability


## CI/CD/CT/CM: Full MLOps Integration  

CI/CD, CT, and CM together creates a fully integrated MLOps system.

- **Continuous integration and deployment**  
  - Ensures smooth development  
  - Keeps models up-to-date  

- **Continuous monitoring and training**  
  - Tracks and improves model performance  
  - Ensures accuracy

Together, CI/CD/CT/CM make MLOps systems robust, automating the entire process from model creation to deployment and maintenance.
