The risk management process typically includes these major steps:

1. **Identify Risks**

    - List assets, threats, vulnerabilities
    - Understand what could go wrong
    - See [Risk Identification](/docs/025-Cybersecurity/021-Risk-and-Governance/032-Risk-Identification.md)

2. **Analyze Risks**

    - Determine likelihood and impact
    - Use qualitative or quantitative methods
    - Decide and prioritize which risks matter most
    - See [Risk Assessment](/docs/025-Cybersecurity/021-Risk-and-Governance/033-Risk-Assessment.md)

3. **Treat or Mitigate Risks**

    - Apply controls to treat the risks
    - Reduce, transfer, accept, or avoid the risk
    - See [Risk Treatment](/docs/025-Cybersecurity/021-Risk-and-Governance/034-Risk-Treatment.md)

4. **Monitor and Review**

    - Continuously track existing risks
    - Watch for new or emerging risks
    - Ensure controls remain effective
