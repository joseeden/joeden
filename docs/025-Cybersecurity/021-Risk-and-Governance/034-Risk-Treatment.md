## Overview

**Risk treatment** involves deciding on the most appropriate actions based on management's risk attitude and the availability and cost of mitigation measures.

## Risk Avoidance

Risk avoidance means removing the risk completely.

- Decision to eliminate a risk entirely.
- May involve halting specific activities.
- Leadership decision when impact or likelihood is deemed too high.

Avoidance helps when a risk is too costly or dangerous to accept.

## Risk Acceptance

Acceptance means choosing to do nothing about the risk.

- Used when impact is small
- Management continues business as usual
- Includes **exemptions** when needed

When a company decides to accept a risk, it should be a decision based on:

- **Cost** - Countermeasure costs more than potential loss.
- **Pain** - The company can live with the vulnerability and threat.
- **Visibility** - The company won’t be viewed as irresponsible in the industry or by stakeholders.

## Risk Mitigation

Mitigation reduces the risk impact or likelihood.

- Most commonly used treatment
- Includes controls and policies
- Reduces but may not eliminate risk

Mitigation ensures risks stay manageable even if they cannot be fully removed.


## Risk Transference

Transference moves the risk to another party.

- Often done through insurance
- Another party handles financial loss
- Used when risk is expensive to manage internally

Transference helps organizations avoid absorbing major financial losses.

## Risk Rejection 

Risk rejection means ignoring a risk without proper evaluation.

- Happens when risks are dismissed
- Often caused by lack of awareness
- Poses major compliance problems

Rejection is dangerous because it leaves the organization exposed without preparation.

## Next Steps: BIA

Once risk responses are in place, it’s important to monitor their effectiveness to ensure assets remain protected as threats evolve. The next step is conducting a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**, which identifies how disruptions could affect operations.

- Finds critical functions
- Evaluates impact of outages
- Supports planning for disasters or attacks

A BIA ensures the organization knows which processes need protection the most.
