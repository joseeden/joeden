## Overview

The forensic investigation process has several key steps to follow in order: 

1. **Identification**: Recognize relevant evidence
2. **Preservation**: Keep evidence intact
3. **Collection**: Gather the data for analysis
4. **Examination**: Inspect the data in detail
5. **Analysis**: Interpret the findings
6. **Presentation**: Share results clearly
7. **Decision**: Draw conclusions for legal or organizational use


## 1. Identification 

Recognizing and determining relevant data or digital evidence.

- Identify the devices and data sources.
- Determine what is considered potential evidence.
- Define the scope and boundaries of the investigation.

## 2. Preservation

Maintaining evidence in its original state to prevent alteration or loss.

- Halt automated deletions or overwrites on systems
- Make backup copies of critical data
- Isolate devices to prevent tampering
- Implement access controls to secure evidence

Preservation ensures that the evidence remains trustworthy for the next phases of the investigation.


## 3. Collection

Gathering and acquiring digital evidence while preserving its integrity.

- Use forensically sound methods to collect data.
- Document each step in the collection process.
- Follow proper acquisition procedure.
- Maintain a clear [chain of custody.](/docs/025-Cybersecurity/040-Digital-Forensics/010-Chain-of-Custody.md)


## 4. Examination

Inspecting the collected data in detail to uncover hidden, deleted, or altered information.

- Review files, logs, and system data systematically
- Use specialized tools to examine different evidence types
- Validate integrity using hashes or checksums
- Note anomalies or suspicious patterns for deeper analysis

Examination bridges the raw collection phase and the analytical phase, providing the details needed to understand the evidence.


## 5. Analysis 

Examining collected data to uncover relevant information, patterns, or evidence.

- Examine the data for hidden, deleted, or altered information.
- Use specialized tools to analyze different types of digital evidence.
- Draw connections and correlations among different data points.

Analysis turns raw data into actionable insights for legal or organizational decision-making.

## 6. Presentation/Reporting

The final phase where findings from the analysis are documented and presented.

- Prepare a detailed and coherent report of findings.
- Ensure the report is accessible to non-technical audiences.
- Highlight evidence handling, conclusions, and recommendations.

This is also the phase where you share the findings clearly with stakeholders or in legal proceedings.

## 7. Decision

Drawing conclusions based on evidence and analysis.

- Determine outcomes based on verified evidence
- Provide recommendations for legal, security, or policy actions
- Document final decisions for accountability and future reference

The decision phase completes the investigation, ensuring findings lead to actionable results and lessons learned.

*Decision* comes after *Presentation*, when the organization or legal team uses the reported findings to make conclusions or take action.

## After Action Review (AAR)

An** After Action Review (AAR)** is a structured process for analyzing incidents or exercises to improve future performance. 

- Evaluate response effectiveness.
- Identify lessons learned.
- Foster continuous improvement.

### Key Components

- **Participation**: Involve all relevant stakeholders for diverse insights.
- **Documentation**: Collect data, timelines, decisions, and actions.
- **Analysis**: Assess successes and failures in processes and outcomes.

### Steps in Conducting an AAR

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Schedule shortly after the incident.
   - Gather reports, logs, and communications.

2. **Conducting the Review**: 
   - Facilitate open discussions.
   - Use guiding questions to evaluate intentions vs. outcomes.

3. **Documenting Findings**: 
   - Summarize key findings and recommendations.
   - Highlight successful strategies and areas needing improvement.

4. **Follow-Up**: 
   - Share the report with stakeholders.
   - Monitor implementation of action items.
