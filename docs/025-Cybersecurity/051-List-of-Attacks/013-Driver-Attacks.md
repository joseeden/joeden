## Driver

A driver is software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices, enabling the functionality of peripherals such as printers, graphics cards, and network adapters.

## Driver Attacks

Driver attacks exploit vulnerabilities within these drivers to gain unauthorized access or control over a system, potentially leading to data breaches, system instability, and other security issues.

## Driver Shimming

Driver shimming involves inserting a layer of code between the operating system and the driver to intercept and modify its behavior.

- Used to add compatibility for older drivers or to monitor and log driver activities.
- Can be exploited to introduce malicious code or alter driver functions.
- May lead to system instability or unauthorized access.

## Driver Refactoring

Driver refactoring entails modifying the internal structure of driver code without changing its external behavior.

- Hidden malicious functionalities are added while preserving normal driver operations.
- Often used to bypass security mechanisms and avoid detection.
- Makes it challenging to identify malicious changes due to the subtle nature of modifications.
