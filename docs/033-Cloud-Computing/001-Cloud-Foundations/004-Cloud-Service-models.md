Got it! I’ve reworked your service model notes so each section has a natural number of bullets, varying between 2–4 depending on the content. It’s still simplified and coherent:

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS delivers applications over the internet that are fully managed by the provider.

- Gmail is an example, accessible from any device without installing software
- Designed for ease of use and broad appeal
- Offers limited customization to focus on simplicity

SaaS lets users use the application while the provider handles updates, security, and infrastructure.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS provides a ready-to-use environment for building and deploying applications.

- Vendor manages hardware, networking, and the operating system
- Developers focus on coding and deploying applications
- Speeds up development by removing environment setup tasks

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS gives full control over virtualized resources while the vendor manages the physical hardware.

- Users configure virtual networks, storage, and operating systems
- Supports any software or application deployment
- Vendor handles hardware maintenance, security, and availability
- Offers the highest level of customization for complex setups

IaaS is ideal when you need flexibility and control over infrastructure without managing physical servers.

## X as a Service (XaaS)

Cloud services continue to expand beyond SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

- Includes disaster recovery, communications, and monitoring services
- Businesses can consume specialized capabilities on demand
- Extends cloud benefits to nearly every IT function
