## The Change of Business Dynamics

Migrating services to the cloud changes business strategy and affects many departments. The impact can be significant.

- **New Sales Approach**

  - Adapt quickly to market changes.
  - Expand offerings with scalable and flexible cloud resources.
  - Free up time from managing services to focus on innovation.
  - Reach new customers and diversify the client base.

- **Advanced Analytics**

  - Analyze large datasets at low cost.
  - Make agile decisions from insights on sales, products, and operations.
  - Understand patterns for better strategic planning.

- **Shift in Responsibility**

  - Transfer infrastructure management to cloud providers.
  - Reduce on-premise tasks like installing or maintaining servers.
  - Build new vendor relationships, sometimes with dedicated account managers.

- **Process Overhaul**

  - Update procedures for finance, support, development, and operations.
  - Document new processes to avoid confusion later.
  - Ensure workloads and responsibilities are clear post-migration.

- **Deployment and Operations Transformation**

  - Use on-demand resources to reduce wait times.
  - Implement automation, serverless computing, and self-healing systems.
  - Test cloud environments that mimic production for fewer errors.

- **Access to Latest Software**

  - Get the newest operating systems and tools.
  - Choose software versions during deployment for up-to-date features.
  - Allow development teams to innovate with new capabilities.

- **Employee Engagement**

  - Communicate changes to reduce fear or resistance.
  - Offer training and feedback opportunities.
  - Keep staff involved to maintain morale and understanding.

- **Resource Recycling**

  - Repurpose redundant hardware for upgrades.
  - Add resiliency via duplication or load balancing.
  - Optimize existing infrastructure for better efficiency.



## Effects on Employees

Cloud adoption changes roles, creates opportunities, and may make some roles redundant. Understanding these effects helps manage transitions.

- **Roles and Opportunities**

  - Create new positions in cloud architecture, implementation, and support.
  - Some employees may resist or feel threatened.
  - Operational teams may split between on-premise and cloud support.
  - Some roles may become redundant as automation increases.

- **Retraining and Skill Transition**

  - Existing skills may not directly transfer; retraining is essential.
  - Encourage certifications like AWS or Azure.
  - Provide guidance for evolving job roles.

- **Reassurance and Communication**

  - Explain safety of roles and offer clear development paths.
  - Maintain open channels for questions and feedback.

- **Training for All Levels**

  - Non-technical staff get basic cloud principles.
  - Technical staff receive vendor-specific and vendor-agnostic training.
  - Offer flexible online or in-person learning.

- **Mobility**

  - Enable remote access for staff and customers.
  - Allow global flexibility with internet connectivity.

- **IT Contribution**

  - Free IT teams to focus on business goals.
  - Use cloud automation to save time for innovation.
  - Improve services and develop new offerings.


## Financial Impact

Cloud migration affects cost models, budgeting, and speed to market, making financial planning a key part of strategy.

- **Capex to Opex**

  - On-premise requires capital expenditure for hardware and maintenance.
  - Cloud shifts costs to operational spending as resources are used.

- **Cloud Billing**

  - Track costs by department or division.
  - Pay based on actual usage to avoid wasted resources.
  - Internal reporting aids budgeting and financial management.

- **IT Budget Changes**

  - Reduce hardware spending and related Capex.
  - Increase software and cloud service budgets.
  - Staffing costs shift from general IT to specialized cloud roles.

- **HR Costs**

  - Adjust for role changes, severance, or recruitment.
  - Recruit cloud specialists until in-house skills develop.

- **Improved Efficiency**

  - Streamline processes for better collaboration.
  - Increase productivity and morale through optimized workflows.

- **Rapid Go-to-Market**

  - Launch products and services faster than on-premise.
  - Increase revenue opportunities with quicker deployments.

## Contractual Business Obligations

Using third-party cloud providers impacts contracts, SLAs, and compliance. Being aware of obligations helps maintain service quality.

- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**

  - Evaluate vendor reliability and service resilience.
  - Check specific SLAs per service, like uptime and error rates.

- **Negotiation and SLA Changes**

  - Negotiate terms if possible to align with customer commitments.
  - Monitor SLA updates as providers may change terms.

- **High Availability Architecture**

  - Design systems to be fault-tolerant across regions.
  - Balance costs against required continuity.

- **Compliance Controls**

  - Cloud providers handle physical security and global regulations.
  - Users remain responsible for application-level compliance.
  - Use tools like AWS Config to monitor and report compliance.


## Business Risks

Cloud adoption carries risks that must be understood and mitigated for a successful migration.

- **Legislation and Regulation**

  - Follow data protection and regional laws.
  - Design systems to meet compliance and security requirements.

- **Technical Skills**

  - Reskill staff to handle new cloud technologies.
  - Lack of skills may affect productivity and security.

- **Third-Party Reliance**

  - Dependence on vendors can limit control.
  - Use high availability and multi-cloud strategies to reduce risk.

- **Contract Limitations**

  - Cloud terms may restrict customization of SLAs.
  - Negotiating specific terms can be challenging.

- **Strategy Misalignment**

  - Post-migration, original cloud strategy may need adjustment.
  - Consider hybrid or alternative deployment options if results differ from expectations.

- **Technology Advances**

  - Cloud providers frequently update services.
  - Adapt applications to leverage new features.

- **Shared Infrastructure**

  - Multi-tenant environments carry potential security risks.
  - Dedicated instances may be required for sensitive workloads.

- **General Risks**

  - Identify and mitigate risks continuously.
  - Expect a learning period to adjust systems and processes.
