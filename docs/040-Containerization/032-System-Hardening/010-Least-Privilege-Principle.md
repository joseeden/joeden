The "Least Privilege" principle in Kubernetes, like in other security contexts, focuses on giving only the minimum required access for tasks or roles.

- Limit access to nodes
- Use RBAC for access control
- Isolate resources with Kubernetes namespaces
- Remove unused packages and services
- Restrict network access
- Disable unnecessary kernel modules
- Close open ports
- Implement pod security policies
- Prevent resource exhaustion and abuse
- Enable audit logging
- Perform regular security reviews

Following the least privilege principle helps reduce unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and security risks in Kubernetes environments.
