## Overview

Metrics let you see how your services are doing.

- Show the health of your traffic router and connected services
- Track request latency and entry points
- Store and visualize data using popular backends

Metrics give you visibility into how your setup behaves so you can spot issues early.

## Supported Backends

Traefik supports multiple backends for metrics.

- Datadog
- InfluxDB
- Prometheus
- StatsD

## Lab: Prometheus Monitoring Stack 

This lab shows how to build a monitoring stack using Prometheus.

- Set up Prometheus to collect metrics from your services
- Use Grafana to visualize these metrics
- Monitor the health and performance of your applications
