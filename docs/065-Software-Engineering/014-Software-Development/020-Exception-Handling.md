## Overview

Good error handling helps keep software safe and working properly. It prevents bugs and security issues by catching and managing problems before they cause damage.

## Key Points

- **Unexpected Behavior**
  - Software can fail when invalid input is processed.
  - Error handling prevents unpredictable states.
  
- **State Transitions**
  - Software should transition smoothly between defined states.
  - Errors can disrupt these transitions, leading to vulnerabilities.

- **Importance of Exception Handling**
  - Provides explicit instructions for error situations.
  - Helps maintain software integrity and security.

## Example of Exception Handling in Java

- **Try-Catch Structure**
  - Code is enclosed in a try block to attempt an operation.
  - A catch block captures specific exceptions, like division by zero.
  
- **User Feedback**
  - Reports errors back to the user for clarity.
  - Ensures the program can handle issues without crashing.
