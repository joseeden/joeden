## Agile Software Development

Agile is a flexible, customer-centered approach to software development. It became official in 2001 with the creation of the Agile Manifesto.

- Adapts to changing requirements
- Delivers small, frequent updates
- Prioritizes customer collaboration
- Encourages continuous feedback and improvement

## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for software development. It emphasizes a customer-focused, iterative approach to software development, with a focus on delivering working software quickly and responding to change in a flexible and adaptive manner.

- **Individuals and interactions**

  - Prioritizes collaboration over processes and tools
  - Emphasizes teamwork and communication

- **Working software**

  - Focus on functional software over comprehensive documentation
  - Delivering a functional product that meets the customer's needs

- **Customer collaboration**

  - Promotes customer collaboration throughout the development process
  - Encourages frequent feedback and iteration from customers

- **Responding to change**

  - Adapts to changing requirements rather than rigidly following a plan
  - Evolving circumstances are a natural part of software development

- **Embracing uncertainty**

  - Recognizes the complexity of development 
  - Promotes flexibility and adaptability

## Agile Principles 

The manifesto lists twelve different principles:

1. **Customer focus**  
   - Deliver software early and continuously.  
   - Prioritize customer satisfaction at every stage.

2. **Embrace change**  
   - Adapt to changing requirements, even late in the project.  
   - Use change as a competitive advantage.

3. **Frequent delivery**  
   - Deliver working software regularly, ideally every few weeks.  
   - Shorter timeframes are preferred for quicker feedback.

4. **Collaboration**  
   - Facilitate daily collaboration between business and developers.  
   - Close communication ensures alignment on goals.

5. **Motivated teams**  
   - Build projects around motivated individuals.  
   - Provide the support and trust needed for them to succeed.

6. **Face-to-face communication**  
   - Face-to-face is the most effective form of communication.  
   - Use it to ensure clarity and quick decision-making.

7. **Working software**  
   - Progress is measured by delivering functional software.  
   - Focus on tangible outcomes over documentation.

8. **Sustainable pace**  
   - Maintain a consistent, sustainable work pace.  
   - Avoid burnout to ensure long-term productivity.

9. **Technical excellence**  
   - Continuous attention to technical quality enhances agility.  
   - Good design improves adaptability to change.

10. **Simplicity**  
   - Focus on the essentials, minimizing unnecessary work.  
   - Keep solutions as simple as possible.

11. **Self-organizing teams**  
   - The best outcomes come from self-directed teams.  
   - Empower teams to make decisions about architecture and design.

12. **Continuous improvement**  
   - Regularly reflect on team performance and processes.  
   - Make adjustments to enhance effectiveness.


## The Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Movement

This movement extends Agile principles to IT infrastructure and operations, emphasizing speed, automation, and collaboration for efficient delivery.

- **Infrastructure as code**  
  - Use code and automation to manage infrastructure.  
  - Increases speed, consistency, and efficiency.

- **Collaboration and communication**  
  - Break down silos between teams for better cross-functional work.  
  - Emphasize open communication across departments.

- **Continuous delivery**  
  - Automate delivery pipelines to release value faster 
  - Deliver value more frequently.

- **Velocity measurement**  
  - Measure and optimize delivery speed by identifying bottlenecks.
  - Eliminate inefficiencies to accelerate delivery and improve quality.

- **Resilience and scalability**  
  - Design systems that can handle changing demands and unexpected failures.
  - Emphasizes the importance of resilience and scalability

## Agile Methods

The Agile Manifesto was intentionally open-ended, allowing for the evolution and adaptation of its ideas. Over time, several popular Agile methodologies have emerged.

- **Agile Scrum**  
  - Focuses on small, self-organizing teams.  
  - Teams work in iterative sprints.  
  - Daily, short meetings to track progress.  
  - Constantly adapt deliverables to meet changing requirements.  
  - Inspired by rugbyâ€™s scrum, where players gather to gain possession of the ball.

- **Lean**  
  - Aims to eliminate wasted effort in planning and execution.  
  - Reduces cognitive load on developers.  
  - Inspired by Lean Manufacturing principles.

- **Extreme Programming (XP)**  
  - More prescriptive about software engineering best practices.  
  - Focuses on improving the quality of life for development teams.  
  - Emphasizes collaborative work and continuous feedback.

- **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**  
  - Develops software feature by feature.  
  - Uses an overall model to estimate and plan feature delivery.  
  - Assigns defined roles for the core development team and support staff.

Of these, Agile Scrum is the most widely used, with common Scrum concepts adopted across many Agile practices.

## Sprints

In the Agile model, the software development life cycle still applies. Unlike the waterfall method, where there is one long iteration of the SDLC, Agile is many quick iterations of the SDLC.

These quick iterations are called sprints, and the purpose of sprints is to accomplish the frequent delivery of working software principle of the Agile manifesto. A sprint is a specific period of time (time-boxed) which is usually between two weeks and four weeks, but preferably as short as possible. The duration of the sprint should be determined before the process begins and should rarely change.

During a sprint, each team takes on as many tasks, also known as user stories, as they feel they can accomplish within the time-boxed duration of the sprint. When the sprint is over, the software should be working and deliverable, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be delivered; a sprint doesn't always lead to a release, but Agile requires the software to remain deliverable.

## Backlog

It is the role of the product owner to create the backlog. This backlog is made up of all of the features for the software, in a prioritized list. The features in the backlog are a result of the Requirements & Analysis phase, and include features that won't necessarily be in the immediate release. New features can be added to the backlog at any time, and the product owner can reprioritize the backlog based on customer feedback.

## User stories

When a feature gets close to the top of the priority list, it gets broken down into smaller tasks called user stories. Each user story should be small enough that a single team can finish it within a single sprint. If it's too large to be completed in a single sprint, the team should break it down further. Because the software must be deliverable at the end of each sprint, a user story must also abide by those rules.

A user story is a simple statement of what a user (or a role) needs, and why. The suggested template for a user story is:

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/devnet-userstories.png)

</div>

Completing a user story requires completing all of the phases of the SDLC. The user story itself should already have the requirements defined by the product owner, and the team taking on the user story needs to come up with a design for the task, implement it and test it.

## Scrum Teams

Scrum teams are cross-functional, collaborative, self-managed and self-empowered. Ideally, these scrum teams should not be larger than 10 individuals, but they should be big enough to finish a user story within a sprint.

Every day, each scrum team should have a daily standup. A standup is a meeting that should last no longer than 15 minutes, and should take place at the same time every day. In fact, it's called a "standup" because ideally it should be short enough for the team to accomplish it without having to sit down.

The goal of the daily standup is to keep all team members in sync with what each person has accomplished since the last standup, what they are going to work on until the next standup, and what obstacles they have that may be preventing them from finishing their task. The scrum master facilitates these standups, and their job is to report and/or help remove obstacles.
