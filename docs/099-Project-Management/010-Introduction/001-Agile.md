## Agile Software Development

Agile is a flexible, customer-centered approach to software development. It became official in 2001 with the creation of the Agile Manifesto.

- Adapts to changing requirements
- Delivers small, frequent updates
- Prioritizes customer collaboration
- Encourages continuous feedback and improvement

## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for software development. It emphasizes a customer-focused, iterative approach to software development, with a focus on delivering working software quickly and responding to change in a flexible and adaptive manner.

- **Individuals and interactions**

  - Prioritizes collaboration over processes and tools
  - Emphasizes teamwork and communication

- **Working software**

  - Focus on functional software over comprehensive documentation
  - Delivering a functional product that meets the customer's needs

- **Customer collaboration**

  - Promotes customer collaboration throughout the development process
  - Encourages frequent feedback and iteration from customers

- **Responding to change**

  - Adapts to changing requirements rather than rigidly following a plan
  - Evolving circumstances are a natural part of software development

- **Embracing uncertainty**

  - Recognizes the complexity of development 
  - Promotes flexibility and adaptability

## Agile Principles 

The manifesto lists twelve different principles:

1. **Customer focus**  
   - Deliver software early and continuously.  
   - Prioritize customer satisfaction at every stage.

2. **Embrace change**  
   - Adapt to changing requirements, even late in the project.  
   - Use change as a competitive advantage.

3. **Frequent delivery**  
   - Deliver working software regularly, ideally every few weeks.  
   - Shorter timeframes are preferred for quicker feedback.

4. **Collaboration**  
   - Facilitate daily collaboration between business and developers.  
   - Close communication ensures alignment on goals.

5. **Motivated teams**  
   - Build projects around motivated individuals.  
   - Provide the support and trust needed for them to succeed.

6. **Face-to-face communication**  
   - Face-to-face is the most effective form of communication.  
   - Use it to ensure clarity and quick decision-making.

7. **Working software**  
   - Progress is measured by delivering functional software.  
   - Focus on tangible outcomes over documentation.

8. **Sustainable pace**  
   - Maintain a consistent, sustainable work pace.  
   - Avoid burnout to ensure long-term productivity.

9. **Technical excellence**  
   - Continuous attention to technical quality enhances agility.  
   - Good design improves adaptability to change.

10. **Simplicity**  
   - Focus on the essentials, minimizing unnecessary work.  
   - Keep solutions as simple as possible.

11. **Self-organizing teams**  
   - The best outcomes come from self-directed teams.  
   - Empower teams to make decisions about architecture and design.

12. **Continuous improvement**  
   - Regularly reflect on team performance and processes.  
   - Make adjustments to enhance effectiveness.


## The Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Movement

This movement extends Agile principles to IT infrastructure and operations, emphasizing speed, automation, and collaboration for efficient delivery.

- **Infrastructure as code**  
  - Use code and automation to manage infrastructure.  
  - Increases speed, consistency, and efficiency.

- **Collaboration and communication**  
  - Break down silos between teams for better cross-functional work.  
  - Emphasize open communication across departments.

- **Continuous delivery**  
  - Automate delivery pipelines to release value faster 
  - Deliver value more frequently.

- **Velocity measurement**  
  - Measure and optimize delivery speed by identifying bottlenecks.
  - Eliminate inefficiencies to accelerate delivery and improve quality.

- **Resilience and scalability**  
  - Design systems that can handle changing demands and unexpected failures.
  - Emphasizes the importance of resilience and scalability

## Agile Methods

The Agile Manifesto was intentionally open-ended, allowing for the evolution and adaptation of its ideas. Over time, several popular Agile methodologies have emerged.

- **Agile Scrum**  
  - Focuses on small, self-organizing teams.  
  - Teams work in iterative sprints.  
  - Daily, short meetings to track progress.  
  - Constantly adapt deliverables to meet changing requirements.  
  - Inspired by rugby’s scrum, where players gather to gain possession of the ball.

- **Lean**  
  - Aims to eliminate wasted effort in planning and execution.  
  - Reduces cognitive load on developers.  
  - Inspired by Lean Manufacturing principles.

- **Extreme Programming (XP)**  
  - More prescriptive about software engineering best practices.  
  - Focuses on improving the quality of life for development teams.  
  - Emphasizes collaborative work and continuous feedback.

- **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**  
  - Develops software feature by feature.  
  - Uses an overall model to estimate and plan feature delivery.  
  - Assigns defined roles for the core development team and support staff.

Of these, Agile Scrum is the most widely used, with common Scrum concepts adopted across many Agile practices.

## Sprints

In Agile, the software development life cycle (SDLC) consists of many quick iterations called **sprints**. Unlike the waterfall method, which has one long iteration, Agile emphasizes frequent delivery of working software.

- **Sprint Duration**  
  - Time-boxed to 2 to 4 weeks, ideally as short as possible.  
  - Duration should be decided beforehand and rarely changed.

- **Sprint Goals**  
  - Teams take on tasks that can be completed within the sprint.  
  - Software must be working and deliverable by end of sprint.
  - Software doesn't necessarily need to be always released.

## Backlog

The **backlog** is a prioritized list of features created by the product owner, derived from the Requirements & Analysis phase. 

- Includes features not in the immediate release.  
- New features can be added anytime.
- Product owner can reprioritize based on feedback.

## User stories

As features rise in priority, they are broken down into **user stories**. 

- Should be small enough to complete in a single sprint.  
- If too large, it should be divided further.

A user story is a simple statement of what a user (or a role) needs, and why. The suggested template for a user story is:

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/devnet-userstories.png)

</div>

Completing a user story requires completing all of the phases of the SDLC, with defined requirements from the product owner. The team taking on the user story needs to come up with a design for the task, implement it and test it.


## Scrum Teams

**Scrum teams** are collaborative, self-managed groups ideally no larger than 10 members. 

- **Daily Standups**  
  - Short meetings (max 15 minutes) held at the same time daily.  
  - Sync team members on accomplishments, goals, and obstacles.  

- **Facilitation**  
  - The scrum master facilitates standups and helps remove obstacles.

Fun fact: it's called a "standup" because ideally it should be short enough for the team to accomplish it without having to sit down.
