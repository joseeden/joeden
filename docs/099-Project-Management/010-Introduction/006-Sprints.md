## The Goal

This is where the magic happens. Youâ€™ll establish short working cycles, often one or two weeks long. At the end of each cycle, you'll deliver an updated, working product. These cycles, called **sprints** or **iterations**, allow for immediate customer feedback, helping you ensure the project is on the right track.

## The Sprint

A typical project might take six sprints, or twelve weeks, to complete. Agile approaches are ideal for producing a product incrementally, especially when there's an urgent need for delivery.

During each sprint, you'll continuously assess progress toward your goals:

- **Sprint Planning**: Schedule a meeting at the beginning of each sprint to plan its goals.
- **Daily Scrum**: Hold brief daily meetings to discuss what was done yesterday, plans for today, and any obstacles.
- **Retrospective**: At the end of each sprint, evaluate what went well and identify areas for improvement.

## Create Your Sprint Schedule

To set up a two-week sprint cycle, follow these steps:

- **Sprint Planning Meeting**: Schedule a two-hour meeting for Monday morning. Attendance is mandatory for the entire team.
- **Daily Scrum Meetings**: Schedule a 15-minute meeting every morning.
- **Retrospective Meeting**: Schedule this for Friday afternoon at the end of each sprint.
