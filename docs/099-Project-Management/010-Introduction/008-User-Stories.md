## User Stories 

User stories are essential tools in agile software development, designed to capture requirements from an end-user perspective and drive the development process with clarity and purpose.


- **What**: It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.

- **Who**: It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.

- **Why**: It's the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.

- **When**: User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.

## Key Questions

- Do the user stories clearly articulate who needs the product, what they need, and why it is important?
- Do the user stories logically contribute to epics and overarching product features?
- Have acceptance criteria been defined for each user story to ensure the delivered solution meets user expectations?

## Creating User Stories

Collaborate with your team to craft user stories using a structured format:

```
“As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit or reason].”
```

Where:

- **As a [user role]**: Specifies the type of user or stakeholder involved.
- **I want to [action]**: Describes what the user wants to achieve or accomplish.
- **So that [benefit or reason]**: Explains the purpose or benefit of fulfilling this user need.

Example:

```
As a gardener, I want to control greenhouse conditions from my phone, so that my plants will stay happy while I’m away.
```
