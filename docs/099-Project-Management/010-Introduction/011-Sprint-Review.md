## Overview

The sprint review meeting is your team’s opportunity to showcase the sprint’s accomplishments through product demos. The goal is to gather feedback from the sponsor on delivered user stories and ensure they align with desired goals and value. It's also a chance to reassess the project vision if necessary.

## Preparation Matters

- Assign each team member a specific area to present.
- Conduct a thorough run-through before the meeting to ensure everyone is prepared.
- Provide relevant data to support discussions during the review.

## Key Questions

- Does the demonstrated work meet your expectations?
- Can you clearly communicate necessary changes to the team?
- Has the team delivered what they committed to? 
- If not, what are the reasons?

## Active Participation

Attend the sprint review meeting prepared to lead and engage:

- Encourage open and direct feedback to foster innovative solutions.
- Address any challenges or constraints effectively to keep the project on track.

Here's an example scenario:

*The product demo shows reliance on expensive national weather data, which isn't feasible for commercial use. How would you address this issue with your team?*

Engaging in constructive discussions will prompt the team to propose alternative solutions and move the project forward effectively.
