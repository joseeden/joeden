## The Goal

This step ensures the project has achieved its goals and meets customer requirements. At this stage, your sponsor has determined that no new features will yield a return on investment, and the product transitions to operations.

## Wrapping It Up

Before closing the project, revisit your initial goals and objectives.

Reflect on lessons learned with your team, celebrating both successes and failures as valuable learning experiences. While the project concludes, the product continues to serve and delight customers.

## Key Questions

- What could we have improved?
- What were our major successes?
- How and when can we share these insights with others to benefit their projects?

## Deliverables and Documentation

- Ensure all documents and deliverables are updated, archived, and issues resolved.

- Centralize all documentation in a shared library accessible to stakeholders outside the team.

- As your team prepares for future projects, celebrate the achievement together.
