## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for software development that was created in 2001. It emphasizes a customer-focused, iterative approach to software development, with a focus on delivering working software quickly and responding to change in a flexible and adaptive manner.

- **Individuals and interactions**   
Agile prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, communication, and teamwork.

- **Working software**   
Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation, recognizing that delivering a functional product that meets the customer's needs is more important than exhaustive documentation.

- **Customer collaboration**   
Agile promotes customer collaboration throughout the development process, emphasizing the importance of frequent feedback, iteration, and continuous improvement.

- **Responding to change**    
Agile values the ability to respond to change over following a plan, recognizing that changing requirements and evolving circumstances are a natural part of software development.

- **Embracing uncertainty**   
Agile embraces uncertainty and complexity, acknowledging that software development is an inherently unpredictable and complex process that requires adaptive, flexible approaches.

## The Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Movement

The Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Movement is an extension of the Agile Manifesto that focuses on applying Agile principles to IT infrastructure and operations. The movement emphasizes the use of automation and collaboration to deliver infrastructure services and support at a faster pace, with greater reliability and efficiency.

- **Infrastructure as code**  
Agile infrastructure emphasizes the use of code and automation to manage and provision infrastructure, enabling greater speed, efficiency, and consistency.

- **Collaboration and communication**   
Agile infrastructure values collaboration and communication across teams and departments, with a focus on breaking down silos and promoting cross-functional collaboration.

- **Continuous delivery**   
Agile infrastructure promotes continuous delivery, enabling teams to deliver value to customers faster and more frequently by automating the delivery pipeline.

- **Velocity measurement**  
Agile infrastructure emphasizes the measurement and optimization of velocity, with a focus on identifying and eliminating bottlenecks and inefficiencies to accelerate delivery and improve quality.

- **Resilience and scalability**  
Agile infrastructure emphasizes the importance of resilience and scalability, with a focus on designing systems that can adapt to changing demands and withstand unexpected failures.
