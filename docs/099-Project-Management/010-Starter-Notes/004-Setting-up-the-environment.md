## The Goal

Ensure the team has a dedicated, effective workspace for the project's duration. This space should be equipped with everything needed for productivity and happiness, like whiteboards, markers, and sticky notes. It should also be accessible to stakeholders for project updates.

## Creating The Right Environment

Involve the team in deciding what their workspace should include. Ask them what they need to be comfortable, productive, and successful within reasonable limits.

## Ground Rules For A Happy Team

Have the team create working agreements or ground rules. Examples include:

- Clear communication guidelines
- Respect for each other's time and space
- Regular check-ins and updates
