## What it is

A Scrum board is a visual tool used to display work items and their current status to team members, sponsors, and other stakeholders. It can be a physical board or a digital one.

## Transparency Is Everything

The Scrum board ensures that everyone can see the status of each work item at any time. It can be placed at a central location or accessed online if the team is remote. This visibility is crucial for effective collaboration.

## Create the Scrum Board 

Select a prominent spot that is easily accessible to all team members. The board should be large enough for everyone to see and interact with. 

Materials needed:

- Whiteboard or large wall space
- Masking or painter's tape
- Sticky notes
- Markers

To set up your Scrum board:

1. Gather your team and hand out sticky notes.
2. Assign colors to different types of tasks or individual team members.
3. Capture each task on a separate sticky note.
4. Place the tasks in the "To Do" column to start.

Team members should update the Scrum board daily.

Keep the workflow efficient by limiting the number of tasks in progress and focusing on moving tasks through the cycle systematically.
