Jira has two primary roles:

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jirausersadminswhattheydo.png)  

</div>



### As a User

Your main responsibility is to update work items (called "issues") daily. Issues track progress, questions, and notes.

- Update issues when work is completed.
- Use issues to ask questions or add notes.
- Regularly update issues to reflect progress.

Issues may vary in size—some may take hours, others months. Each issue has an assigned person responsible for updating it.


## Working in Jira

<div class='img-center'>

</div>

## Jira Project

A project in Jira is a collection of issues that helps organize work. Every issue belongs to a project, which is named based on how your team structures its work.

- Project name is visible under the Jira logo.
- View all projects via the 'Projects' dropdown in the navigation bar.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiraprojectview1.png)

</div>



### Project Names

Project names give insight into how work is organized in Jira.

- Projects can be named after teams or specific deliverables.
- Helps identify how work is structured within Jira.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiraprojectnaming.png)

</div>

### Types of Jira Projects

There are two main types of Jira projects:

- **Team-managed projects**: for smaller teams controlling their own processes.
- **Company-managed projects**: standardized for larger teams, managed by Jira admins.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiratypesofproejcts.png)

</div>

These types determine how workflows and team management are handled in Jira.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/openjiraproject.png)

</div>






## Boards 

Boards visually track work progress with columns for statuses like "To Do" and "Done."

- **Workflow:** Issues move through stages (e.g., `To Do → Done`).
- **Moving Issues:** Drag issue cards across columns to update progress.

### Moving Issue Cards

These board columns have headers at the top representing the  status  of each issue. For example, statuses could be: 

- To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

Issues can move forward and backward in a workflow, depending on how the work gets done.


### Board Names

Boards are part of projects and named after teams or deliverables.

- Boards exist within projects and may have multiple boards.
- Board names focus on teams or deliverables.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


### How do you see all of your boards?

You probably have more than one board. Each Jira project often has multiple boards within it. To see all of your boards, navigate to the left project sidebar and select the board dropdown.

👇 Look at the example screen to see how this works. In this example, the team has multiple boards within the "Game Design Team" project. Their boards are named after different games (deliverables) they are working on: Farm Harvest, Galaxy Action II, and Street Car Racer.

</div>


### Board Types

Boards help organize work.

- **Kanban:** Continuous workflow without fixed deadlines.
- **Scrum:** Work done in sprints, ideal for agile teams.

## Agile and Scrum

**What is agile?** Agile is a project management methodology. It takes an iterative approach to managing projects, focusing on continuous release that require regular updates based on feedback. Agile helps teams increase delivery speed, expand collaboration, and better respond to market trends. Learn more about agile here.

**What is scrum?** Scrum is a specific agile project management framework to help design, develop, and deliver complex products. It's mostly used by software development teams. Scrum teams organize their work in sprints. A sprint is a short, fixed period when a scrum team works to complete a batch of issues. Learn more about scrum here.

**How are agile and scrum different?** Agile is a broad project management philosophy with a core set of values and principles. Scrum is one specific agile framework, a way of using those principles to get actual work done.

### Getting Around in Jira 

What's the best way to get around in Jira?

Start with these two navigation bars:

* the  **main navigation bar**  at the top of your screen
* the  **project sidebar**  on the left of your screen

At the top of your screen, the main navigation bar helps you find your work, projects, and teammates. It also allows you to create issues, search for work, and adjust your settings.

On the left of your screen, the project sidebar is a collapsible navigation bar that shows you options specific to the project you're viewing.

## Working with Issues 

### What's inside an issue? 

What's inside an issue? When you open an issue, you'll see the issue detail view.

In this view, you'll see many  issue fields . Issue fields include the editable items such as the due date, assignee, comments from teammates, priority levels, and links to related media.

### How do you open an issue to see its details?

1. Start from the board view. Navigate to the project sidebar and select 'Kanban Board' or 'Board.'
2. Find an issue card and click to open it.

### Explore the common issue fields

The example screens below highlight the most common issue fields. Your specific fields will be customized based on your team. Check with your project manager or Jira admin to know which specific issue fields your team will be using.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/commonissuefields.png)  

</div>


### Issue key

The issue key is a unique identifier given to each issue. Issue keys contain the project key and a sequential number. In the example below, the issue key is GD-8.

Why is this field important? The issue key helps you find issues or refer to work with your teammates.

To the left of the issue key is a small icon. This icon indicates the issue type. You'll learn more about issue types below.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuekey.png)  

</div>


### Summary

The summary is the short title or name of the issue.

Why is this field important? The summary helps you quickly recognize the issue. It appears on the issue card as the issue name.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuefieldsummary.png)  

</div>


### Attachments and Links

The attachments and links fields allow you to add relevant media, links, and URLs to each issue.

Why are these fields important? They help enrich an issue by connecting the issue to related media.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuefieldattachlinks.png)  

</div>


### Description 

The description is a place to add supporting details about the issue.

Why is this field important? The description helps you better explain and understand an issue.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuedescription.png)  

</div>



### Types of Issues 

There are different types of issues based on their size and category of work.

Some issues are large. Others are small. Some are about starting new work. Others are about fixing old problems.

With a wide variety of work, teams need different ways to categorize their different issues. The  issue type  tells you the category and size of the work to get done.

In Jira Software, the default issue types are 
- epic, 
- task, 
- story, 
- bug, and 
- subtask 

These issue types are organized into a hierarchy based on the size and category of work.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/defaulttypeofissues.png)  

</div>


### Epic

An  epic  is a large initiative. Known as "parent" issues, epics contain smaller issues within them. They often represent large bodies of work that can break down into smaller tasks. It will be up to you and your team to decide what's a large initiative and what's not.

### Task

A  task  is the most common issue type. They contain a more detailed description of a work item. Tasks can exist within a larger epic or exist all on their own.

### Story

A  story  is a feature or requirement from the user's perspective. Stories are commonly used by software development teams. They define work items in non-technical language. For example, "As a user, I need a back button on this screen." Stories are at the same hierarchical level as tasks, and some teams use the two issue types interchangeably.

### Bug

A  bug  describes a problem or error, mostly used in software development teams. They can exist within a larger epic or exist all on their own.

### Subtask

A  subtask  is a further defined issue, used to break down tasks, stories, or bugs into smaller work items. Subtasks must have a parent issue type. They cannot exist on their own.

### How are issue types used?

🚀 Imagine a game design team building a space-inspired video game. They use the default issue types — epics, tasks, stories, bugs, and subtasks — to organize their work.

### How to update and create issues

You've got an issue open. Which fields should you update?

This depends on your team's preferences and how your work is set up. However, there are a few fields you'll likely update often. The most common fields you'll update are the **status** and **comment** fields.

### Update the status

By now, you know a lot about statuses. Whenever your work progress has changed, you'll update the issue's status.  For example, if you're ready to start work on an issue, you would change the status from To Do to In Progress.

✅ How do you update the status? There are two ways. 

- On the board view, you can drag and drop the issue into a different column. Or, 
- in the issue detail view, you can click the status dropdown and select the new status.

### Add comments

Comments should be your go-to issue field. They provide the best way to ask questions and share updates. You can also @mention teammates to bring attention to important info.

✅ When should you use comments? Use comments when you need to communicate progress, ask a question, find resources, or receive feedback. You can also add reactions to comments with popular emojis like 👍 or 🔥.

### How often should you update issues?

Try to make Jira a daily habit and update your issues every day. When work progress changes or you need to ask a question, default to updating the issue in Jira. This practice will help everyone on your team stay in the loop.

📩For any issues you own or have starred, you'll receive email notifications. When a teammate @mentions you in a comment, Jira sends you an email. That email has a link that takes you directly to the issue. Email notifications are a great way to remind yourself to update your issues.

### How to create new issues

Some teams prefer that only project managers or scrum masters create new issues. Other teams allow any Jira user to create new issues. Before you start creating your own issues, check with your project manager.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/createnewissue1.png)  

</div>


The simplest way to create new issues is to click the '**Create**' button in the main navigation bar.

### Which fields should you fill out?

Start with the required information: project, issue type, and summary. The description field is optional, but filling it out helps give your issue more context.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/createissuefillupfields.png)  

</div>


1. **Project** - Which project the issue belongs
2. **Issue Type** - epic, story, task, bug, or subtask 
3. **Summary** - short title, but descriptive
4. **Description** - Supporting info related to issue
5. **Create** - once filled-up, hit Create! 

### You created an issue! Now where did it go?

The best place to look for your new issue is the  backlog . The backlog shows a list of issues that haven't been started yet. You'll learn more about the backlog in the next lesson.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/backlog.png)  

</div>


Ready to update an issue yourself?

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/updateissueready.png)  

</div>


### Views and search in Jira

Switch views to see your work. Search for issues you can't find.

### Backlog and Roadmap 

To view your daily work, boards will probably be your go-to view. But the  backlog  and  roadmap  are other important views that give you a different perspective on your work.

The backlog shows issues that have yet to be started. The roadmap shows all issues in a linear timeline.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/backlogsroadmaps.png)  

</div>


> *Here's something valuable to know: Your team may not have the backlog or roadmap enabled. If you don't see them on your screen, check with your team leader or Jira administrator.*

### The backlog shows issues not yet started

Not every issue is worked on right away. Your team probably plans issues for the future. These issues will sit in the backlog until they are ready to start.

How do you access the backlog? On your project sidebar, select 'Backlog.' Some teams also customize their boards to show the 'Backlog' in a column.

### The roadmap shows the big picture in a timeline view

Sometimes it's helpful to see how issues start, end, and overlap. The roadmap view shows issues in a linear timeline. This helps teams map dependencies and plan work accordingly.

How do you access the roadmap view? On the project sidebar, select 'Roadmap.' If you don't see this option, navigate to your main navigation bar and select 'Plans.' In the dropdown, you may see a 'Roadmap' option.

### Search for issues you can't find

There are two simple ways to search for issues: the **search bar**  and **basic search.**

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/seachbarbasicsearch.png)  

</div>


### Use the search bar to find issues quickly

The search bar is located near the top right of the main navigation bar. Here are some tips for using it:

🔍 Click in the search box to see recent work. Before typing a single word, the search bar populates a list of recent issues, boards, projects, and filters.

🔍 Let Jira guess your search. As you type, Jira tries to guess what you're searching for. Watch your screen for instant search results, even before you’ve finished typing.

🔍 Can't remember the issue name? Search for any related word. Jira will scan other fields like descriptions and comments to find your issue.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/searchbardemo.png)  

</div>


### Use basic search for more specific criteria

Try basic search if the search bar didn't work for you. In basic search, you can filter and sort issues by specific criteria.

### JQL 

If you still can't find your issues, there is a more advanced search feature called Jira Query Language, or JQL. You can learn more about JQL [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-advanced-searching-in-jira-cloud/).
