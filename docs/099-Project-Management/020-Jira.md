- **Transparency:** Everyone can see work progress.
- **Efficiency:** Teams can plan and track start and end dates.
- **Collaboration:** Keeps team discussions and comments well-organized.

### As a User

Your main responsibility is to update work items (called "issues") daily. Issues track progress, questions, and notes.

- Update issues when work is completed.
- Use issues to ask questions or add notes.
- Regularly update issues to reflect progress.

Issues vary in sizeâ€”some may take hours, others months. Each issue has an assigned person responsible for updating it.
