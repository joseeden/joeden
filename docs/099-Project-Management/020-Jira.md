## Jira Roles

Jira has two primary roles:

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jirausersadminswhattheydo.png)  

</div>



### As a User

Your main responsibility is to update work items (called "issues") daily. Issues track progress, questions, and notes.

- Update issues when work is completed.
- Use issues to ask questions or add notes.
- Regularly update issues to reflect progress.

Issues may vary in size—some may take hours, others months. Each issue has an assigned person responsible for updating it.


## Working in Jira

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiratour.png)  

</div>

## Jira Project

A project in Jira is a collection of issues that helps organize work. Every issue belongs to a project, which is named based on how your team structures its work.

- Project name is visible under the Jira logo.
- View all projects via the 'Projects' dropdown in the navigation bar.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiraprojectview1.png)

</div>



### Project Names

Project names give insight into how work is organized in Jira.

- Projects can be named after teams or specific deliverables.
- Helps identify how work is structured within Jira.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiraprojectnaming.png)

</div>

### Types of Jira Projects

There are two main types of Jira projects:

- **Team-managed projects**: for smaller teams controlling their own processes.
- **Company-managed projects**: standardized for larger teams, managed by Jira admins.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/jiratypesofproejcts.png)

</div>

These types determine how workflows and team management are handled in Jira.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/openjiraproject.png)

</div>






## Boards 

Boards visually track work progress with columns for statuses like "To Do" and "Done."

- **Workflow:** Issues move through stages (e.g., `To Do → Done`).
- **Moving Issues:** Drag issue cards across columns to update progress.

### Moving Issue Cards

These board columns have headers at the top representing the  status  of each issue. For example, statuses could be: 

- To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

Issues can move forward and backward in a workflow, depending on how the work gets done.


### Board Names

Boards are part of projects and named after teams or deliverables.

- Boards exist within projects and may have multiple boards.
- Board names focus on teams or deliverables.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/howareboardsnamed.png)  

</div>


### How do you see all of your boards?

You probably have more than one board. Each Jira project often has multiple boards within it. To see all of your boards, navigate to the left project sidebar and select the board dropdown.

👇 Look at the example screen to see how this works. In this example, the team has multiple boards within the "Game Design Team" project. Their boards are named after different games (deliverables) they are working on: Farm Harvest, Galaxy Action II, and Street Car Racer.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/readytofindboars.png)  

</div>


### Board Types

Boards help organize work.

- **Kanban:** Continuous workflow without fixed deadlines.
- **Scrum:** Work done in sprints, ideal for agile teams.

## Agile and Scrum

**What is agile?** Agile is a project management methodology. It takes an iterative approach to managing projects, focusing on continuous release that require regular updates based on feedback. Agile helps teams increase delivery speed, expand collaboration, and better respond to market trends. Learn more about agile here.

**What is scrum?** Scrum is a specific agile project management framework to help design, develop, and deliver complex products. It's mostly used by software development teams. Scrum teams organize their work in sprints. A sprint is a short, fixed period when a scrum team works to complete a batch of issues. Learn more about scrum here.

**How are agile and scrum different?** Agile is a broad project management philosophy with a core set of values and principles. Scrum is one specific agile framework, a way of using those principles to get actual work done.

### Getting Around in Jira 

What's the best way to get around in Jira?

Start with these two navigation bars:

* the  **main navigation bar**  at the top of your screen
* the  **project sidebar**  on the left of your screen

At the top of your screen, the main navigation bar helps you find your work, projects, and teammates. It also allows you to create issues, search for work, and adjust your settings.

On the left of your screen, the project sidebar is a collapsible navigation bar that shows you options specific to the project you're viewing.

<div class='img-center'>

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/getaroundjira3.png)  

</div>


> Here's something valuable to know: The options in your navigation bars may look different than the screens in this course. Navigation bars can be customized based on your Jira product, project settings, and team preferences.

### What's in the main navigation bar?

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/mainnavbar.png)  

</div>


1. **Product switcher:** Allows you to switch to other Atlassian products your team may be using, like Confluence or Bitbucket.

2. **Your work:** Shows issues, projects, and boards you’ve recently visited. And allows you to view all work assigned to you.

3. **Projects:** Shows a list of all of your projects. And includes a button to create new projects.

4. **Filters and Dashboards:** View any saved or starred filters and dashboards to see your work. You'll learn more about filters and dashboards in future courses.

5. **People:** Shows a list of the people and teams you interact with most.

6. **Plans, Insight, and Apps:** Allows you to manage your plans and see apps installed on your Jira instance (for premium users only).

7. **Create:** A quick way to create new issues.

8. **Search:** Open text search field to help you find issues, projects, boards, queues, filters, and people.

9. **Settings and Profile**: Customize your personal settings, set up your profile, and control email notifications.

### What are starred items? ⭐

You may notice some items with stars beside them. In Jira, you can  star  your most important projects, boards, and filters so you can easily find them later. 

Specifically in the 'Your work' and 'Projects' dropdowns, Jira organizes your starred items and shows them first. You can reorder your starred items by going to Your work > Starred.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/staritems.png)

</div>


## Working with Issues 

### What's inside an issue? 

What's inside an issue? When you open an issue, you'll see the issue detail view.

In this view, you'll see many  issue fields . Issue fields include the editable items such as the due date, assignee, comments from teammates, priority levels, and links to related media.

### How do you open an issue to see its details?

1. Start from the board view. Navigate to the project sidebar and select 'Kanban Board' or 'Board.'
2. Find an issue card and click to open it.

### Explore the common issue fields

The example screens below highlight the most common issue fields. Your specific fields will be customized based on your team. Check with your project manager or Jira admin to know which specific issue fields your team will be using.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/commonissuefields.png)  

</div>


### Issue key

The issue key is a unique identifier given to each issue. Issue keys contain the project key and a sequential number. In the example below, the issue key is GD-8.

Why is this field important? The issue key helps you find issues or refer to work with your teammates.

To the left of the issue key is a small icon. This icon indicates the issue type. You'll learn more about issue types below.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuekey.png)  

</div>


### Summary

The summary is the short title or name of the issue.

Why is this field important? The summary helps you quickly recognize the issue. It appears on the issue card as the issue name.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuefieldsummary.png)  

</div>


### Attachments and Links

The attachments and links fields allow you to add relevant media, links, and URLs to each issue.

Why are these fields important? They help enrich an issue by connecting the issue to related media.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuefieldattachlinks.png)  

</div>


### Description 

The description is a place to add supporting details about the issue.

Why is this field important? The description helps you better explain and understand an issue.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/issuedescription.png)  

</div>



### Types of Issues 

There are different types of issues based on their size and category of work.

Some issues are large. Others are small. Some are about starting new work. Others are about fixing old problems.

With a wide variety of work, teams need different ways to categorize their different issues. The  issue type  tells you the category and size of the work to get done.

In Jira Software, the default issue types are 
- epic, 
- task, 
- story, 
- bug, and 
- subtask 

These issue types are organized into a hierarchy based on the size and category of work.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/defaulttypeofissues.png)  

</div>


### Epic

An  epic  is a large initiative. Known as "parent" issues, epics contain smaller issues within them. They often represent large bodies of work that can break down into smaller tasks. It will be up to you and your team to decide what's a large initiative and what's not.

### Task

A  task  is the most common issue type. They contain a more detailed description of a work item. Tasks can exist within a larger epic or exist all on their own.

### Story

A  story  is a feature or requirement from the user's perspective. Stories are commonly used by software development teams. They define work items in non-technical language. For example, "As a user, I need a back button on this screen." Stories are at the same hierarchical level as tasks, and some teams use the two issue types interchangeably.

### Bug

A  bug  describes a problem or error, mostly used in software development teams. They can exist within a larger epic or exist all on their own.

### Subtask

A  subtask  is a further defined issue, used to break down tasks, stories, or bugs into smaller work items. Subtasks must have a parent issue type. They cannot exist on their own.

### How are issue types used?

🚀 Imagine a game design team building a space-inspired video game. They use the default issue types — epics, tasks, stories, bugs, and subtasks — to organize their work.

### How to update and create issues

You've got an issue open. Which fields should you update?

This depends on your team's preferences and how your work is set up. However, there are a few fields you'll likely update often. The most common fields you'll update are the **status** and **comment** fields.

### Update the status

By now, you know a lot about statuses. Whenever your work progress has changed, you'll update the issue's status.  For example, if you're ready to start work on an issue, you would change the status from To Do to In Progress.

✅ How do you update the status? There are two ways. 

- On the board view, you can drag and drop the issue into a different column. Or, 
- in the issue detail view, you can click the status dropdown and select the new status.

### Add comments

Comments should be your go-to issue field. They provide the best way to ask questions and share updates. You can also @mention teammates to bring attention to important info.

✅ When should you use comments? Use comments when you need to communicate progress, ask a question, find resources, or receive feedback. You can also add reactions to comments with popular emojis like 👍 or 🔥.

### How often should you update issues?

Try to make Jira a daily habit and update your issues every day. When work progress changes or you need to ask a question, default to updating the issue in Jira. This practice will help everyone on your team stay in the loop.

📩For any issues you own or have starred, you'll receive email notifications. When a teammate @mentions you in a comment, Jira sends you an email. That email has a link that takes you directly to the issue. Email notifications are a great way to remind yourself to update your issues.

### How to create new issues

Some teams prefer that only project managers or scrum masters create new issues. Other teams allow any Jira user to create new issues. Before you start creating your own issues, check with your project manager.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/createnewissue1.png)  

</div>


The simplest way to create new issues is to click the '**Create**' button in the main navigation bar.

### Which fields should you fill out?

Start with the required information: project, issue type, and summary. The description field is optional, but filling it out helps give your issue more context.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/createissuefillupfields.png)  

</div>


1. **Project** - Which project the issue belongs
2. **Issue Type** - epic, story, task, bug, or subtask 
3. **Summary** - short title, but descriptive
4. **Description** - Supporting info related to issue
5. **Create** - once filled-up, hit Create! 

### You created an issue! Now where did it go?

The best place to look for your new issue is the  backlog . The backlog shows a list of issues that haven't been started yet. You'll learn more about the backlog in the next lesson.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/backlog.png)  

</div>


Ready to update an issue yourself?

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/updateissueready.png)  

</div>


### Views and search in Jira

Switch views to see your work. Search for issues you can't find.

### Backlog and Roadmap 

To view your daily work, boards will probably be your go-to view. But the  backlog  and  roadmap  are other important views that give you a different perspective on your work.

The backlog shows issues that have yet to be started. The roadmap shows all issues in a linear timeline.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/backlogsroadmaps.png)  

</div>


> *Here's something valuable to know: Your team may not have the backlog or roadmap enabled. If you don't see them on your screen, check with your team leader or Jira administrator.*

### The backlog shows issues not yet started

Not every issue is worked on right away. Your team probably plans issues for the future. These issues will sit in the backlog until they are ready to start.

How do you access the backlog? On your project sidebar, select 'Backlog.' Some teams also customize their boards to show the 'Backlog' in a column.

### The roadmap shows the big picture in a timeline view

Sometimes it's helpful to see how issues start, end, and overlap. The roadmap view shows issues in a linear timeline. This helps teams map dependencies and plan work accordingly.

How do you access the roadmap view? On the project sidebar, select 'Roadmap.' If you don't see this option, navigate to your main navigation bar and select 'Plans.' In the dropdown, you may see a 'Roadmap' option.

### Search for issues you can't find

There are two simple ways to search for issues: the **search bar**  and **basic search.**

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/seachbarbasicsearch.png)  

</div>


### Use the search bar to find issues quickly

The search bar is located near the top right of the main navigation bar. Here are some tips for using it:

🔍 Click in the search box to see recent work. Before typing a single word, the search bar populates a list of recent issues, boards, projects, and filters.

🔍 Let Jira guess your search. As you type, Jira tries to guess what you're searching for. Watch your screen for instant search results, even before you’ve finished typing.

🔍 Can't remember the issue name? Search for any related word. Jira will scan other fields like descriptions and comments to find your issue.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/searchbardemo.png)  

</div>


### Use basic search for more specific criteria

Try basic search if the search bar didn't work for you. In basic search, you can filter and sort issues by specific criteria.

### JQL 

If you still can't find your issues, there is a more advanced search feature called Jira Query Language, or JQL. You can learn more about JQL [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-advanced-searching-in-jira-cloud/).

## Build your Jira Habit 

**What's the biggest difference between pro and novice Jira users?**

You guessed it: how often they use the tool. Novice users aren't consistent. They rarely check Jira. They don't keep issues up-to-date. This inconsistency creates confusion and frustration among teammates.

**Pro users make Jira part of their daily routine.** They have a habit of checking and updating Jira continuously each day. These pros realize using Jira consistently helps them be better at their jobs. More productive. More organized. More collaborative. A higher-performing teammate, overall.

**You too can build a daily Jira habit and become a productivity pro.** Add Jira to your daily routine, and you'll quickly see the benefits.

### Why make Jira a daily habit?

Building Jira into your routine will benefit you in your job and career. Here's how:

✅ It'll keep you organized. Updating Jira daily means all your work is in one place. Each day you have a single location to view your current and upcoming work. You can see which issues are top priorities to get done first.

✅ It'll help you track your performance. Keeping your Jira issues up-to-date means you have data on your work performance. This data can be a powerful tool to use in career conversations with your manager.

✅ It'll keep you in the loop on your team's work. Team transparency is a luxury. Using Jira every day means you and your teammates know what's happening across your projects. It's a great way to stay connected and up to speed.

### How to build your daily Jira habit

### Keep Jira open, always

Make Jira easy for you to access. No need to log in and out. Stay logged in and keep the tab open in your browser, always.

Are your Jira browser tabs challenging to find? Try this: Create a color-coded tab group called "My Jira Boards." If you have many tabs open, the color code and label help you find your Jira boards quickly. Another option is to keep an entire browser window open dedicated only to your Jira projects.

### Start your workday with Jira

For many humans, the most consistent routines are at the start of the workday. Many of us check email. Or browse our calendars. This is a perfect opportunity to bring Jira into the mix.

Try adding Jira to the current stack of your workday activities. After browsing your calendar, open Jira. In less than 60-seconds, you can see all your work tasks to help prioritize your day.

After a few weeks of checking Jira at the start of the workday, you'll be more focused and organized than ever before.

### Commit to a month-long Jira streak

A habit streak is when you complete a task continuously over a long period. It's a powerful tactic to make any new behavior stick. Habit streaks help you focus on repeating a behavior day in and day out, quickly making it part of your permanent routine.

Try challenging yourself to use Jira every day for an entire month. Each day it'll take just a few minutes of your time. After one month, you'll have built a healthy habit that's part of your routine.

Keep yourself accountable by adding events to your calendar. For example, try setting 15-min calendar events that repeat daily to remind you to "Check Jira and update issues."

You can track your Jira habit streak with a habit-tracking smartphone app. Or in your calendar.

### Be the Jira champion on your team

Remember, Jira works best if your entire team uses it every day. With your new Jira skills, you can be your team's productivity advocate and get everyone on board.

**How does this help you build your habit?** When you encourage others to use Jira, your own habit is positively reinforced. Your efforts will quickly grow into consistent Jira habits for everyone on your team.

**Try using Jira to document all team-related questions and activities.** Start small by keeping your issues up-to-date. If a teammate asks you for an asset related to an issue, add the asset in a comment in the Jira issue. Then @mention your teammate to let them know. Be consistent in this practice for every teammate's request. Over time, your teammates will get the picture and default to managing their work in Jira.

### Optimize Jira for you

You'll use Jira more often if it's set up exactly how you'd like. As a flexible tool, Jira has a variety of features for you to customize. You can adjust personal settings, set notification frequency, create custom work views, connect Jira to other tools, and much more. 

## Optimize Jira for You

You probably spend a lot of time with issues. Creating. Updating. Managing. While there are no set rules around issues, there are a few simple strategies that can make your life easier. 

### Issue Best Practices

### 1. Write short and clear summaries

The summary is the title of an issue. Summaries are required for every new issue you create. The best practice is to keep each summary between 4-7 words. Write them in crisp and precise language so anyone on your team can understand at a glance. Here are a few suggested writing formats to try:

**Tasks** - Write task summaries like this: "<ACTION> <ACTIVITY/THING>." (e.g., "Build new homepage")

**Stories** - Write story summaries like this: "As a <PERSONA>, I want <THING>." (e.g., "As a user, I want a back button")

**Bugs** - Write bug summaries like this: "<FEATURE> should do <X>, but does <Y>." (e.g., "Menu button should show menu, but errors out")

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/bestpracticesummary.png)  

</div>


### 2. Create multiple issues at a time with the roadmap or backlog

You may need to create more than one issue at a time. When planning new initiatives from start to finish, you can create a sequence of new issues from a single view. Both the roadmap and backlog provide this option.

➡️ **To create multiple issues from the roadmap**, select the button 'Create issue.' Type in a summary. Save your changes by selecting 'Review changes' at the top right of your screen.

➡️ **To create multiple issues from the backlog**, scroll to the bottom of the backlog and select 'Create issue.' Type in a summary.

### 3. Flag important issues

You can add a flag to any issue to indicate its importance. When a flag is added, a small flag icon will be visible on the issue card and the issue card will turn yellow.

It's a great way to bring awareness to any issue that requires escalation. You may need to flag an issue that is in danger of missing its delivery date. Or flag an issue that's blocked by another task or problem.

To add a flag to an issue:

* Open an issue
* Select the ellipses ••• and select Add flag

### 4. Use email notifications to stay connected

Email notifications help you stay on top of your issues. By default, Jira sends you a lot of emails. But they're all important! 

📥 Anytime an issue changes status or you are **@mentioned** in a comment, you'll get an email. While it may feel like overload, these emails keep you well-connected to your issues and your team.

Every email from Jira includes a direct link to the issue. While you can change your email notification settings in Jira (as you'll learn soon), we recommend that you keep your notifications turned on. It'll help you be efficient and in the know on all work related to you.

### 5. Use comments for every communication

Comments should be your go-to feature in Jira. They are the ultimate tool to collaborate with your team and keep work organized. 

Use comments to document any update, question, or request, even if it feels trivial. This way, your team will see the entire history of an issue's progress through the workflow. This can help you more accurately plan your future work.

The best practice is to use comments to communicate progress, ask questions, find resources, ask for opinions, get ideas, request feedback, and @mention teammates. When used consistently, comments create a source of truth for your work. They gather updates in one place and allow anyone on your team to get up to speed quickly.

If there's one best practice to take away from this lesson, use the Jira comments. For every communication!

### Personalize your settings

Jira is a flexible tool, allowing for a variety of customizations. While your Jira admin or team leader will set up many customizations, there are a few important settings you can control.

To access your personal settings:

* Select your profile picture icon at the top right
* Select 'Personal settings'
* Update your preferences and select 'Save changes'

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


**1. Your timezone**
Set your date and timezone preferences.

**2. Language**
Change your preferred language.

**3. Watch your issues**
Automatically become a watcher of any issue that you create or comment on. This means you'll get an email when someone updates or comments on the issue. 

**4. Your Jira homepage**
Choose your preferred homepage. When you click on the Jira logo in the top left, it will take you to your selected page.

**5. Email notification preferences**
Choose how and when you receive email notifications.

### Tips on How to Personalize your Settings 

### 1. Stay in the loop by enabling 'Watch your issues'

👀 With this setting, you automatically become a watcher of any issue you interact with. This means you will receive notifications any time there is an update to the issue.

Why is this helpful? It helps you keep track of your work, always. In Jira, you'll often work on issues where someone else is the assignee. You're still a contributor, though. You still need to know about updates and changes to the issue.

By enabling 'Watch your issues,' you'll automatically stay in the loop with email notifications. If the emails get overwhelming, remember you can always un-watch an issue to stop receiving the messages. To un-watch an issue, click the eye icon within the issue details.

</div>


### 2. Set the Jira homepage to 'Your work'

Your default homepage may be set to the 'Project directory.' While this can be helpful at times, most users prefer to see the work assigned to them. To do this, set your homepage to 'Your work.'

**Why is this helpful?** It helps you find your work quickly and effortlessly. The 'Your work' screen shows items you've recently worked on or viewed. Recent projects, boards, and issues can all be found with a few clicks. Change the homepage to 'Your work,' and you'll never be too far from your most important projects and tasks.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


### 3. Personalize your email preferences

As you know, email is the best way to stay on top of your issues. Jira's default email settings are all-inclusive. You get emails for nearly any issue change. Each email has a direct link to the issue, making it easy to see and respond.

📩 In your personal settings, you can change the volume of emails you receive. If you prefer to receive fewer emails, uncheck the boxes for activities you're not interested in. You can always come back to your settings and update preferences as you wish.

**Our recommendation is to keep the email settings as all-inclusive as you can manage**. This will help you stay on top of your work. And keep you informed of work going on around you. If emails become unwieldy, try setting up an email filter. Scroll down to learn how.

### 4. Manage Jira emails with a custom email filter

Okay, so this tip is going to take us on a brief detour outside of the world of Jira. But it's related to Jira emails, and most pro users find it extremely helpful. 

If you feel you're receiving too many emails from Jira, set up a filter using your email client. Many users find email filters are a better way to manage Jira emails instead of changing their email preference settings. With a filter, you still get the important emails. But now, they're labeled, categorized, and not cluttering your inbox.

To set up an email filter, you'll need to do some light research to understand your email client. Know that the sender's email will always be jira@<yourinstance>.atlassian.net

### Create simple views and dashboards

Jira gives you many ways to see your work: boards, backlogs, roadmaps, and others you'll learn soon. In previous courses, you learned the basics of these views. Now, you'll learn how to get the most out of them.

Applying these best practices will save you time finding and organizing work in Jira. You'll know exactly which view is best for every situation. And you'll be able to navigate to find the information you need.

### 1. Use the board as your default view

As you're using Jira each day, default to the board view. It is the most practical view, giving you a quick snapshot of all current and upcoming work.

**Give this a try** - Filter to see only your issues. This feature helps you cut through the clutter and focus on your work only. To do this, select your profile icon above the board. Or select the 'Only My Issues' button.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/viewdefault.png)  

</div>


### 2. Reorder your issues in the board view

Take complete control of how your issues are organized on your board. Within a single board, drag and drop issues vertically to organize them as you wish. Just be careful not to move an issue to the next column until it's ready!

Some users prefer to organize their issues by date. Others prefer to organize by large initiative. Test out a few different strategies and see what you like.

**Give this a try** - Find any column on your board and drag an issue above another issue to change its order.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


### 3. Save important searches as filters

Jira's basic search feature allows you to save filters for future use. A filter groups issues into a single view based on a set of search criteria. A saved filter can be shared with teammates, pulled as a report, or displayed in a dashboard (which you'll learn more about below).

Give this a try - Save a search as a filter:

* Set your search specs and click 'Search' 
* Near the top of the page, click 'Save as'
* Type a name for your filter and click 'Submit'

Once the filter is saved, you can share or export your filter by using the buttons at the top right of your screen.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


### 4. Use dashboards to see everything all at once

A dashboard is a customized screen to give you a high-level snapshot of everything happening in Jira. Dashboards are made up of small configurable blocks called gadgets.

Your default dashboard may have gadgets like Introduction, Projects, Assigned to Me, and Activity Stream. Any gadget can be edited or deleted. The overall dashboard layout is entirely customizable.

You can create multiple dashboards for different projects. Or one single dashboard that spans all the work you're involved with.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/viewusedashboardtoseeall.png)  

</div>


### How to create your own dashboard

### Step 1 - Create a new dashboard

* On the main navigation bar, select Dashboards > Create dashboard
* Give your dashboard a name and description and select Save

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/createstep1.png)  

</div>


### Step 2 - Add your gadgets

Gadgets are the building blocks of your dashboard. There are dozens of gadgets to choose from. Here's how to add gadgets to your dashboard:

* At the top right of your window, select Add gadget
* Scroll through the available gadgets and select Add gadget

**What are the most popular gadgets for users?** It depends on how you use Jira. If you're not sure where to start, here are the four gadgets we recommend.

* **Issues in progress**: Shows all your issues currently in progress.
* **Assigned to Me:** Shows all unresolved issues assigned to you.
* **Activity Stream:** Shows recent activity across your entire project.
* **Created vs. Resolved Chart:** Shows a charted comparison of created issues and resolved issues to give you a sense of your workload.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/createstep2.png)  

</div>


### Step 3 - Organize your gadgets and test your dashboard

Just like that, your new dashboard is ready to go. You can organize your gadgets by dragging and dropping them where you wish. If you find a gadget that isn't useful, delete it and add a new one.

Many gadgets require you to set up filters before they can be used properly. You'll learn more about filters and dashboards in future courses. But, for now, take some time to get familiar with the basics and test it out yourself. 

Every new dashboard is only visible to you. So feel free to explore new gadgets and filters to get the information you need.

### Connect Jira with other tools

Slack, Microsoft, Zoom, Google, and thousands more. Jira can integrate with 3,000+ tools to help improve your productivity and efficiency. Today we'll cover some of the most popular integrations to help optimize your Jira experience.

Here are the best practices for connecting Jira with other tools.

### 1. Integrate with Confluence to better manage projects

The easiest (and most recommended) tool to connect with Jira is Confluence, another Atlassian product. Confluence is a remote-friendly workspace to help your team build pages and manage information.

Connecting Jira and Confluence creates one place for your team to build, organize, and collaborate on work. 76% of Jira Software customers say they shipped projects faster after adding Confluence to help organize and manage agile projects.

If your team isn't using Confluence yet, it's worth a try. It'll make a world of difference to help manage your projects.

<div class='img-center'>

![](/img/docs/integrateconfluence.png)  

</div>


### 2. Integrate with Slack for simpler communications

Connecting Jira and Slack gives you real-time insight into your Jira projects. This integration helps you and your team be aware of any issue changes the second they occur.

Instead of email notifications, this integration sends you Slack notifications when issues are created or updated. Connect Jira projects to Slack channels, so your entire team gets updates. Plus, you can create new issues directly from Slack.

If your team is already using Slack, the Jira add-on is an easy way to keep your work organized and in sync.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


### 3. Integrate with Microsoft for smooth collaboration

Jira's integration with Microsoft Teams works wonders. This integration simplifies backlog collaboration and communication across your team. Within the Microsoft Teams tool, you can easily create tabs with issues. Plus, track and discuss your team’s progress directly in your channel.

If your team is already using Microsoft Teams, the Jira add-on is a simple way to keep your work and communications together. Note that for this integration, you will need administrator access.

<div class='img-center'>

</div>


### 4. Integrate with Zoom to start meetings from any issue

Rather than toggling between calendars, the Zoom integration allows you to schedule video meetings directly from any issue. Every watcher of the issue will be automatically added to the invite. And the meeting links and details will be added to the issue comments. Record a video meeting, and the file and transcript will also be in the Jira comments.

If your team is already using Zoom, the Jira add-on is a helpful way to connect your work tasks with face-to-face communications.
