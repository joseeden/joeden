#### As a User

Your main responsibility is to update work items (called "issues") daily. Issues track progress, questions, and notes.

- Update issues when work is completed.
- Use issues to ask questions or add notes.
- Regularly update issues to reflect progress.

Issues may vary in size; some may take hours, others months. Each issue has an assigned person responsible for updating it.
