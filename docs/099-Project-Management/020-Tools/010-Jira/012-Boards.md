## Overview 

Boards visually track work progress with columns for statuses like "To Do" and "Done."

- **Workflow:** Issues move through stages (e.g., `To Do → Done`).
- **Moving Issues:** Drag issue cards across columns to update progress.

## Moving Issue Cards

These board columns have headers at the top representing the  status  of each issue. For example, statuses could be: 

- To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

Issues can move forward and backward in a workflow, depending on how the work gets done.


## Board Names

Boards are part of projects and named after teams or deliverables.

- Boards exist within projects and may have multiple boards.
- Board names focus on teams or deliverables.
