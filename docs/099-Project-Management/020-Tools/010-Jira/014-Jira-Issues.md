## Overview

Issues in Jira represent tasks, bugs, features, or any work item. Each issue contains various fields that help track its progress and details.

- Issue fields - due date, assignee, comments, priority, and attachments
- Access issues by selecting an issue card from the board view

## Types of Issues 

Jira categorizes issues by size and type to help teams organize work. The issue type defines the category and scope of the task.

- **Epic**

    A large initiative that contains smaller tasks or issues. Used for breaking down significant work.

- **Task**

    The most common type of issue, representing a specific work item. Tasks can stand alone or be part of an epic.

- **Story**

    A user-focused requirement or feature, often written in non-technical language. It‚Äôs at the same level as a task.

- **Bug**

    Describes an error or problem, primarily in software development. Bugs can exist on their own or within an epic.

- **Subtask**

    A smaller work item that is part of a task, story, or bug. It cannot exist independently.

## How are issue types used?

Teams organize work using different issue types like epics, tasks, stories, bugs, and subtasks to manage varying sizes and categories of work.

## Update Issues

When working on an issue, you‚Äôll often update the **status** and **comments** fields depending on your team‚Äôs setup. These fields help track progress and communicate effectively.

### Update Status

Change the issue status to reflect work progress, such as moving it from "To Do" to "In Progress." There are two ways to update the status:

- On the board view, drag and drop the issue into a different column
- In the issue detail view, click status dropdown and select new status

### Add Comments

Use comments to ask questions, share updates, or seek feedback. You can also mention teammates with @mentions to bring attention to important details or use emoji reactions like üëç or üî• to engage with the discussion.


### How often should you update issues?

Update your issues daily to keep your team informed. Email notifications remind you when someone mentions you or updates an issue.


## Create New Issues

Use the **Create** button in the main navigation bar. Fill in the project, issue type, summary, and optionally a description for context. Your new issue will appear in the backlog. 

<div class='img-center'>

</div>

Explore the backlog for newly created issues and update progress as needed.


### Issue Fields

To create an issue, start by entering the required fields. Optionally, add a description for more context. Once done, hit "Create."

1. Project - Defines which project the issue belongs to
2. Issue Type - Specifies if it‚Äôs an epic, story, task, bug, or subtask
3. Summary - Short, descriptive title
4. Description - Additional details (optional)
5. Create - Final step to submit
