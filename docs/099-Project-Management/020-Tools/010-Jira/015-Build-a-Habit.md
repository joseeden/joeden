## Build a Habit

Making Jira part of your daily routine can improve your productivity and team collaboration. 

## Using it Daily 

- **Stay organized**: See all your work in one place and prioritize tasks effectively.

- **Track performance**: Use Jira data to review your progress and discuss career growth with your manager.

- **Improve team transparency**: Stay updated on your team’s work and collaborate better.


## Tips for Building a Habit

- **Keep Jira open**: Stay logged in and keep it in an easy-to-find tab or a dedicated browser window.

- **Start your day with Jira**: Check Jira after reviewing your email and calendar to prioritize your tasks for the day.

- **Commit to a streak**: Use Jira daily for a month to build the habit. Set reminders or track your progress using apps.

- **Encourage your team**: Promote Jira use across the team to reinforce your own habit and improve team productivity.

## Optimize Jira 

By setting it up to fit your workflow, managing and updating issues becomes much easier.

- Adjust settings, like notification frequency
- Create custom views to organize your work
- Connect Jira with other tools





## Best Practices on Handling Issues

### 1. Write short and clear summaries

Summaries are the titles of issues and should be 4-7 words long, using precise language.

- **Tasks** - Write task summaries like this: 

    ```bash
    <ACTION> <ACTIVITY/THING>
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    Build new homepage
    ```


- **Stories** - Write story summaries like this: 

    ```bash
    As a <PERSONA>, I want <THING>.
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    As a user, I want a back button
    ```    

- **Bugs** - Write bug summaries like this: 

    ```bash
    <FEATURE> should do <X>, but does <Y>.
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    Menu button should show menu, but errors out
    ```

### 2. Create multiple issues at a time

When planning, you can create several issues from a single view. 

➡️ In the roadmap, select 'Create issue' and review your changes. 
➡️ In the backlog, scroll to the bottom and create the issue directly.

### 3. Flag important issues

Flags highlight critical issues. Adding a flag turns the issue card yellow, helping prioritize tasks that are blocked or need urgent attention. 

To add a flag to an issue:

- Open an issue
- Select the ellipses ••• and select Add flag

### 4. Use email notifications 

Jira sends notifications for status changes or when you're @mentioned. These emails keep you updated and provide direct links to issues. While you can adjust settings, keeping notifications on ensures you're always informed

### 5. Use comments for every communication

Comments are important for collaboration and organizing work. Use them for progress updates, asking questions, and @mentioning teammates. Consistent commenting creates a transparent history of the issue and keeps everyone in the loop.
