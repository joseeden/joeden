## Agile and Scrum

**Agile** is a project management methodology focusing on iterative development, continuous releases, and regular updates based on feedback.

- Increases delivery speed and collaboration
- Helps teams adapt to market changes

**Scrum** is an agile framework, primarily used by software teams, organizing work into short, focused periods called sprints.

- Focuses on completing a batch of issues within a sprint
- Emphasizes team collaboration and incremental progress


## Boards 

Boards visually track work progress with columns for statuses like "To Do" and "Done."

- **Workflow:** Issues move through stages (e.g., `To Do â†’ Done`).
- **Moving Issues:** Drag issue cards across columns to update progress.

### Moving Issue Cards

These board columns have headers at the top representing the  status  of each issue. For example, statuses could be: 

- To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

Issues can move forward and backward in a workflow, depending on how the work gets done.


### Board Names

Boards are part of projects and named after teams or deliverables.

- Boards exist within projects and may have multiple boards.
- Board names focus on teams or deliverables.
