### Confidentiality

Confidentiality refers to protecting information from unauthorized access. It is all about ensuring only authorized individuals can access sensitive data.

- **Confidentiality Challenges**
  - Balancing confidentiality in systems with numerous guest or customer users.
  - Unknown security status of user devices complicates achieving confidentiality.

- **Security Professional's Role**
  - Obligation to regulate access.
  - Protecting sensitive data while allowing access for authorized individuals.

- **PII and Related Terms**
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) linked to confidentiality.
  - Other terms: Protected Health Information (PHI), classified/sensitive information.

- **Sensitivity in Information**
  - Sensitivity as a measure of information importance.
  - Harm to the organization or individuals if improperly disclosed or modified.

- **External Stakeholder Impact**
  - Sensitivity often linked to harm to external stakeholders.
  - External entities not part of information-processing organization.

### Integrity

Integrity is about safeguarding the accuracy and reliability of data. It is all about preventing unauthorized modification or tampering of information.

- **Application**
  - information or data
  - systems andâ€¯processes for business operations
  - organizations
  - people and their actions

- **Data Integrity**
  - Ensures data remains unaltered in an unauthorized manner.
  - Protection during storage, processing, and transit to prevent modification, errors, or loss.
  - Information must be accurate, internally consistent, and useful.
  - Consistency ensures data is uniform across systems, maintaining the same form, content, and meaning.

- **System Integrity**
  - Maintaining a known good configuration and expected operational function.
  - Begins with awareness of the system's current state, establishing a baseline for future comparisons.

- **Baseline for Integrity**
  - Establishing a baseline to document and understand the state of data or a system.
  - Ongoing protection to preserve the baseline state through transactions.

- **Comparing Baseline for Integrity**
  - Regular comparison of baseline with the current state.
  - Match indicates intact integrity, while a mismatch signifies compromise.

- **Regulatory and Organizational Needs**
  - Safeguarding integrity may be dictated by laws or organizational requirements.
  - Crucial for accessing reliable, accurate information and maintaining system reliability.
  
### Availability

Availability refers to ensuring that authorized users have access to information when needed.

- **Core Concept**
  - Data accessible where and when needed, in the required form.
  - Not necessarily 100% availability; meets business requirements for timely and reliable access.

- **Criticality and Security Professional's Role**
  - Critical systems require appropriate availability levels.
  - Consultation with the business to identify and ensure availability of critical systems.

- **Association with Criticality**
  - Availability linked to criticality, reflecting the importance an organization assigns to data or information systems.
  - Crucial for operations and mission achievement.

### Relationship between Confidentiality and Integrity 

Confidentiality and integrity are separate but complementary security concepts. Confidentiality protects against unauthorized access, while integrity ensures data remains accurate and unaltered.
