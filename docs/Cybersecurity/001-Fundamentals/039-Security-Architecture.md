## Security Architecture

Design, structure and behavior of an organization's information security environment.

- **On-Premise**
    - Local infrastructure.
    - Data processed and stored on-site.
    - Direct control over hardware and software.

- **Cloud**
    - Internet-based services.
    - Hosted and managed by third-party providers.
    - Pay-per-use model.

- **Hybrid**
    - Combination of on-premise and cloud.
    - Integrates local infrastructure with cloud services.
    - Offers flexibility and scalability.


## On-Premises Data Centers

When it comes to data centers, there are two primary options: organizations can outsource the data center or own the data center. If the data center is owned, it will likely be built on premises. A place, like a building for the data center is needed, along with power, HVAC, fire suppression and redundancy.

## Virtualization 

Virtualization involves creating virtual instances of computing resources, such as servers, storage devices, or networks, to maximize resource utilization and flexibility.


### Hypervisors

Hypervisors are software or firmware that create and manage virtual machines (VMs).

- **Type-1 (Bare Metal)**

    - Installed directly on the physical hardware.
    - Provides direct access to hardware resources.
    - Typically used in enterprise data centers and cloud environments.
    - Examples: VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, KVM.

- **Type-2 (Hosted)**

    - Installed on top of an operating system.
    - Relies on the host OS for hardware access.
    - Often used for development, testing, and desktop virtualization.
    - Examples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop.

### VM Vulnerabilities 

- **VM Escape**

    - Exploiting vulnerabilities to break out of a virtual machine's isolation.
    - Allows unauthorized access to the host system or other VMs.
    - *Example:* 
        - CVE-2018-3646: A vulnerability in Intel CPUs allowed malicious code running in a virtual machine to access memory outside its allocated space, potentially compromising the host system.
    - *Mitigation:* 
        - Regularly update hypervisor software to patch known vulnerabilities. 
        - Implement strict access controls and isolation techniques.

- **Privilege Escalation**

    - Elevating user privileges within a virtualized environment.
    - Grants unauthorized access to sensitive resources or capabilities.
    - *Example:* 
        - CVE-2019-14849: A vulnerability in the Linux Kernel allowed users with lower privileges to escalate their privileges and gain root access within a virtual machine.
    - *Mitigation:* 
        - Apply operating system patches and security updates promptly. 
        - Implement least privilege principles.
        - Regularly audit user permissions to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

- **Live VM Migration**

    - Intercepting data during the migration process.
    - Potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized entities.
    - *Example:* 
        - Insecure VM migration protocols or misconfigured network settings may expose sensitive data during live VM migrations.
    - *Mitigation:* 
        - Encrypt data during VM migration to prevent interception. 
        - Implement secure network configurations.
        - Restrict access to migration interfaces.

- **Resource Reuse**

    - Exploiting leftover resources from previously used virtual machines.
    - Can lead to unauthorized access or data leakage.
    - *Example:* 
        - Residual data left in memory or storage after a VM is terminated may be exploited to access sensitive information.
    - *Mitigation:* 
        - Use secure deletion techniques to ensure that data remnants are properly erased. 
        - Implement memory and disk scrubbing mechanisms to prevent residual data exploitation. 
        - Regularly monitor and audit resource allocation to detect and mitigate resource reuse vulnerabilities.    

### Securing VMs 

Securing VMs are almost similar with how we secure physical servers.

- Hypervisors needs to be regularlly updated, patched, and secured.
- Limit the connections between VMs and the physical machines.
- Minimize and remove unneeded features to reduce potential vulnerabilities.
- Consider VM distribution across different servers.
- Beware of **VM Sprawl** - Provisioning VMs without proper oversight.
- Enable encryption of the file that hosts the VM.

## Serverless 

Serverless is an approach where cloud providers manage the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code.

- Resources are provisioned dynamically and automatically scale based on demand.
- Billed based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity.
- Eliminates the need for managing servers, operating systems, or infrastructure components.
- Enable faster development and deployment cycles.

### Vendor Lock-in

It is a situation where a customer becomes dependent on a particular vendor's products or services to an extent that switching to another vendor becomes impractical or costly..

- Developers heavily utilize proprietary services or features provided by a specific cloud provider.
- This makes it challenging to migrate to another provider in the future.

Mitigation:

- Using open standards
- Implementing abstraction layers
- Designing applications for portability to reduce dependency on specific vendor offerings.


## Microservices 

Microservices is an architectural approach where applications are composed of small, independently deployable services. Each service is focused on a specific business function and communicates with others through APIs. This allows for modularity, flexibility, and scalability, enabling teams to develop, deploy, and maintain services independently.

### Monolithic vs Microservices 

- **Monolithic**
    - Single, unified codebase and application.
    - Components tightly integrated and deployed together.
    - Scaling involves replicating the entire application.
    - Development, testing, and deployment are typically done as a single unit.
    - Changes and updates require redeploying the entire application.
    - Simple to develop and initially deploy.
    - Can become complex and difficult to maintain as the application grows.

- **Microservices**
    - Application divided into small, independently deployable services.
    - Each service focuses on a specific business function.
    - Services communicate through APIs or message queues.
    - Scaling is done at the service level, allowing for more efficient resource utilization.
    - Development, testing, and deployment can be done independently for each service.
    - Enables continuous deployment and faster iteration.
    - Additional overhead for managing service communication and orchestration.

### Benefits
