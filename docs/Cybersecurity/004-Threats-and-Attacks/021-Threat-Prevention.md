### Identify Threats

Protecting against all attacks requires multiple steps, and implementing fundamental measures can guard against various threats. Here are examples of actions to safeguard networks:

- **Service and Protocol Management**
   - If a service or protocol is unnecessary, it should be deactivated. Attackers cannot exploit vulnerabilities in inactive services or protocols.

- **Firewall Implementation**
   - Firewalls, whether network-based or host-based, are effective defenses against various attacks. Network-based firewalls secure entire networks, while host-based firewalls protect individual systems.


### Preventing Threats

While there is no single step to protect against all threats, several basic measures can significantly reduce the risk of various types of threats.

- **Keep Systems Updated**
  - Regularly apply patches released by vendors.
  - Implement patch management for timely updates.

- **Disable Unneeded Services**
  - Remove or disable unnecessary services and protocols.
  - Reduces vulnerability to potential attacks.

- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**
  - Implement systems that observe and detect threats.
  - Provide alerts and can block or stop attacks.

- **Anti-Malware Software**
  - Utilize up-to-date anti-malware software.
  - Countermeasure against various types of malicious code.
