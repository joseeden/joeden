- Install WAPs at a height to prevent physical tampering.
- Use signal strength mapping tools to identify optimal placement locations.
- Ensure adequate coverage in high-traffic areas to maintain performance.
- Consider potential sources of interference, such as microwaves and other electronic devices

### ESS Configuration

An Extended Service Set (ESS) configuration extends wireless coverage by interconnecting multiple wireless access points (WAPs) to provide seamless connectivity across a larger area. Proper configuration ensures efficient network performance and robust security.

- **SSID Management**
  - Use a consistent SSID for all access points to enable seamless roaming.
  - Hide SSID broadcast to enhance security.
  
- **Channel Assignment**
  - Configure non-overlapping channels to minimize interference.
  - Utilize automatic channel selection features if available.
  
- **Security Settings**
  - Apply strong encryption methods (WPA3) across all access points.
  - Implement consistent security policies and access controls.
  
- **Load Balancing**
  - Distribute client connections evenly across access points to prevent overload.
  - Adjust power settings to manage coverage and client distribution.
  
- **Roaming Optimization**
  - Enable fast roaming protocols (802.11r) to improve client handoff between access points.
  - Configure access points to support seamless transition without connection drops.
  
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**

### Interference Considerations

When deploying multiple wireless access points in an ESS configuration, interference must be carefully managed. Interference can degrade signal quality and reduce network efficiency, and there are only a limited number of channels that most wireless access points can use.

- **Co-Channel Interference**

    - Multiple WAPs in the same area, operate on the same channel or frequency bands
    - Reduces overall network throughput as devices contend for the same channel.
    - Signals between WAPs collide, requiring the data to be re-transmitted.
    - Re-transmission of data slows down the network since additional traffic is added.
    - Mitigate by using proper channel planning and spacing out access points.

- **Adjacent Channel Interference**

    - Happens when access points operate on overlapping channels.
    - Causes signal overlap and interference, reducing network performance.
    - Avoid by selecting non-overlapping channels (e.g., 1, 6, 11 in the 2.4 GHz band).
