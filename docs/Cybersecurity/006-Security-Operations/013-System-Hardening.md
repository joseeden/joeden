## Hardening 

Hardening is the process of applying secure configurations (to reduce the attack surface) and locking down various hardware, communications systems and software, including the operating system, web server, application server and applications, etc.

- Applying security patches
- Configure access controls
- Disable unnecessary services 
- Adopt best practices

## Reducing system elements

Reducing the number of system elements is a system hardening technique that removes unnecessary software and services to reduce the attack surface. 

## Configurations 

### Changing Default Configurations 

When setting up new systems or devices, default configurations are often used to simplify the initial setup process. However, these default settings can pose significant security risks if not properly managed. Below are some common default configurations that should be addressed to enhance security.

- **Default Passwords**

  - Devices and software often come with preset passwords.
  - Default credentials are widely known and can be easily exploited by attackers.
  - Examples include "admin/admin" or "root/root".
  - Always change default passwords to strong, unique ones upon installation.

    </div>
    -->

- **Unneeded Ports and Protocols**

  - Default configurations may enable more services than necessary.
  - Open ports and running protocols can provide additional attack surfaces.
  - Common unnecessary services include Telnet and FTP.
  - Disable or close any ports and protocols that are not required for operation.
  - If you're using SMTP, use the secure versions, SMTPS and HTTPS.


- **Extra Open Ports**

  - Systems may have several ports open by default for various services.
  - Ports 22, 23, 80, and 443 are open by default on some devices.
  - Often done by manufacturers to provide maximum compatibility.
  - Extra open ports can be entry points for unauthorized access.
  - Regularly review and close any ports that are not in use.
  - Use firewall rules to restrict access to essential ports only.


### Configuration management 

Configuration management ensures that authorized and validated changes are the only ones made to a system. It involves decision-making and control procedures, focusing on aspects like identification, establishing baselines, and applying updates and patches.

- **Identification**

    - Baseline identification of a system and all its components, interfaces and documentation.

- **Baseline**

    - A security baseline is a reference point that sets the minimum accepted level of security requirements. 
    - It ensures updates adhere to essential security standards.
    - Security baselines are used to guarantee that network devices, software, hardware and endpoints are configured consistently. 

- **Change Control**   

    - Process for requesting changes to a baseline, with a review and approval process for updates and patches.

- **Verification and Audit**    

    - Ensure system integrity after changes and an audit to validate the current baseline against its initial baseline plus approved changes.

## Restricting Applications

### Least Functionality

Ensuring systems and devices operate with the least functionality necessary reduces the attack surface and minimizes security risks. This principle involves disabling or removing all non-essential features, services, and applications.

- **Minimize Installed Applications**

  - Install only the applications needed for the system's purpose.
  - Regularly review and uninstall unnecessary software.

- **Disable Unnecessary Services**

  - Turn off services that are not required for the system's operation.
  - This includes services like file sharing, remote desktop, and print services.

- **Limit User Access**

  - Restrict user permissions to the minimum required to perform their tasks.
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user privileges.

- **Use Minimal Software Versions**

  - Opt for software versions with the least number of features that meet requirements.
  - Avoid using versions with unnecessary add-ons or plugins.

- **Regularly Update and Patch**

  - Ensure all essential software is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
  - Remove or replace unsupported or obsolete software versions.

### Secure Baseline Image 

In large networks, the best solution is to prevent excessive installations. To achieve this, we can use a **secure baseline image** for all workstations. This image will have:

- Operating system 
- Minimum applications required
- Strict configuration policy

### Noncompliant to Security Baselines 

Whenever a device is found not compliant with the security baseline, it may be disabled or isolated into a quarantine area until it can be checked and updated

### Filtering Applications

**Whitelisting/Allowlisting**

- Allows only authorized applications; blocks all others.
- Requires creating a list of approved applications.
- Greater control, prevents malware, and unauthorized applications.

**Blacklisting/Blocklisting**

- Preventing listed applications from running.
- Blocks known malicious software.
- Doesn't prevent unknown threats.

**Graylisting**

- Temporarily blocks emails from unknown senders.
- Requires the sender to resend the email.

## Trusted Operating Systems (TOS)

Trusted Operating Systems (TOS) are designed with enhanced security features to ensure a higher level of protection and integrity for the system. These systems are particularly suitable for environments where security is a critical concern.

- Implement fine-grained access control mechanisms.

## Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) 

### Features 

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a powerful security module for Linux that implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies. Developed by the NSA, it enhances the security of Linux systems through the following features:

- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

  - Enforces strict policies controlling access to files, processes, and resources.
  - Prevents unauthorized actions by users and applications.
  - Policies are defined by the administrator and enforced by the kernel.

- **Fine-Grained Security Policies**

  - Allows detailed specification of security rules.
  - Policies can be customized to fit specific security requirements.
  - Controls access based on a wide range of attributes and contexts.

- **Context-Based Permissions**

  - Uses security contexts to determine access permissions.
  - Every file, process, and system resource is labeled with a security context.
  - Access decisions are made based on these contexts.

- **Isolation and Containment**

  - Helps in isolating applications and users to prevent the spread of security breaches.
  - Limits the potential damage from compromised processes or accounts.
  - Ensures that applications run with the minimum necessary privileges.

  - Simplifies the administration of access controls.
  - Ensures users have only the permissions necessary for their role.

### Context-based Permission Schemes

**SELinux**

- Each file, process, and system resource is labeled with a security context.
- A security context consists of a type and a domain. 
- Access decisions are based on these labels
- This enforces strict policies to prevent unauthorized access and actions.
- Sample SELinux Configuration:

    ```bash
    # Example SELinux policy rule
    allow httpd_t user_home_t:file { read getattr };
    ```

**AppArmor**

- Linux security module, offers application-level access control through the use of profiles.
- Each profile defines a set of rules specifying the allowed resources and operations
- This enhances security by limiting the scope of potential attacks.
- Sample AppArmor Configuration:

    ```bash
    # Example AppArmor profile for the Apache web server
    /usr/sbin/apache2 {
    # Allow read access to the Apache configuration files
    /etc/apache2/apache2.conf r,
    /etc/apache2/conf.d/ r,
    /etc/apache2/conf.d/** r,
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/ r,
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/** r,
    
    # Allow read access to web content directories
    /var/www/ r,
    /var/www/** r,
    
    # Allow access to log files
    /var/log/apache2/ r,
    /var/log/apache2/** rw,
    }
    ```

### SELinux Contexts 

SELinux defines security contexts for various system entities, helping to enforce access controls and policies.

- **User**: Represents the identity of the user accessing the system.
- **Role**: Defines the role or set of permissions associated with a user.
- **Type**: Specifies the type of object, such as files, processes, or devices, and the associated security policy.

Common User contexts:

| User Context   | Description                                      |
| unconfined_u   | Unrestricted access to resources.                |
| user_u         | Regular user without admin privileges.           |
| sysadmin_u     | Access to system administration tasks.           |
| root           | Superuser with full access to system resources.  |

Common Role contexts:

| Role Context   | Description                                            |
| object_r       | Role assigned to objects such as files and directories.|
| system_r       | Role assigned to system-related processes and services.|
| user_r         | Role assigned to regular user processes.               |

Common Type contexts: 

| Type Context       | Description                                                    |
| file_t             | Type assigned to regular files.                                |
| dir_t              | Type assigned to directories.                                   |
| process_t          | Type assigned to processes.                                     |

To view the SELinux contexts for running processes:

```bash
$ ps -eZ 

system_u:system_r:dhcpc_t:s0             1869 ?  00:00:00 dhclient
system_u:system_r:sshd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023  1882 ?  00:00:00 sshd
system_u:system_r:gpm_t:s0               1964 ?  00:00:00 gpm
system_u:system_r:crond_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 1973 ?  00:00:00 crond
system_u:system_r:kerneloops_t:s0        1983 ?  00:00:05 kerneloops
system_u:system_r:crond_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 1991 ?  00:00:00 atd
```

### Multi-level Security Context 

SELinux provides support for multi-level security contexts through a fourth context which indicates the sensitivity levels.

| Sensitivity Level | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| s0                | Lowest sensitivity level                   |
| s1                | Intermediate sensitivity level             |
| s2                | Higher sensitivity level                   |
| s3                | Highest sensitivity level                  |

### SELinux Modes

SELinux operates in three modes:

- **Enforcing Mode**

  - Enforces security policies, denying actions that violate rules.
  - Provides active protection against policy violations.
  - Ensures strict adherence to security policies.

- **Permissive Mode**

  - Logs policy violations without enforcing them.
  - Allows actions that would otherwise be denied for monitoring purposes.
  - Provides insights into potential policy issues without affecting system behavior.

- **Disabled Mode**

  - Completely disables SELinux.
  - No security policies are enforced.
  - System operates without SELinux restrictions.

These modes allow administrators to control SELinux behavior based on their security requirements and system configurations. To show the current mode: 

```bash
sestatus
```

To change the mode: 

```bash
sudo setenforce enforcing   # Switch to enforcing mode
sudo setenforce permissive  # Switch to permissive mode
```

To completely disable SELinux (switch to disabled mode), change the value of SELINUX to disabled.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/selinux/config 
```

### SELinux Policies

SELinux supports various policies, including:

- **Targeted Policy**

  - Default policy used in Red Hat Linux and CentOS.
  - Applies SELinux restrictions selectively to targeted processes.
  - Leaves other processes unconfined.
  - Offers a balance between security and flexibility.
  
- **Strict Policy**

  - Enforces SELinux restrictions on all processes.
  - Provides a higher level of security.
  - May require more configuration effort to manage.

## Group Policies 

A group policy is a set of rules or policies that can be applied to a set of users or computer accounts within an operating system. 

- In Windows environment, open Run > gpedit
- Each policy acts as a security template containing a set of rules:
  - Password requirements 
  - Account lockout policies 
  - Software restrictions 
  - Application restrictions
- Used to create a secure baseline as part of configuration management
- Active Directory Domain Controllers hava advanced Group Policy Editor.

### Baselining 

The process of measuring changes in the network, hardware, or software environment.

- Establish normal configurations for the organization.
- By knowing what's normal, we can also identify what's considered a deviation.
- Any deviations are compared to the known baseline to determine if it is expected.
