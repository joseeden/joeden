- Update and maintain software to address bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

### Service Providers

Service providers offer essential services such as maintenance, support, and consulting, which are crucial for the effective operation of technologies and systems in organizations.

- Evaluate data security measures, such as confidentialiy and integrity.
- Ensure cybersecurity protocols are robust enough to protect the organization's data.
- Should be able to provide necessary support and cooperation in case of security breach.

## Supply Chain Attacks

Supply chain attacks involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the supply chain to gain unauthorized access to systems, often targeting weaker links such as suppliers or managed service providers (MSPs) rather than the primary targets directly.

- Instead of targeting a well-fortified entity, attackers can target suppliers and MSPs.
- Cisco routers and switches are often the source of supply chain attacks.

### Hardware-based Attacks

**Chip Washing**
- Involves repackaging the contents of a microchip with a less expensive one.
- Appliances with counterfeit chips can lead to system crashes.
- Worse, these devices may contain malware or always-on backdoors.

**Rootkits**
- May be embedded within devices acquired from overseas suppliers.
- Pre-installed malware tools can provide backdoor access once the devices are active.
- It's important to conduct thorough vendor assessments to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

### Software-based Attacks

Software supply chain attacks involve compromising software during development or distribution stages.

- Attackers can introduce malicious code into legitimate software updates.
- Difficult to detect, as they often exploit trusted sources within the supply chain.
- Regular audits and integrity checks, to prevent unauthorized modifications in software.

### CHIPS Act of 2022 

The CHIPS Act, officially known as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, is designed to address supply chain vulnerabilities and promote innovation in the semiconductor industry, which is critical for a wide range of technologies from consumer electronics to advanced military systems.

- Funding to build and expand semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the U.S.

  - Include specific security requirements and responsibilities in contracts with suppliers.
  - Establish clear terms for security breaches, corresponding penalties, or remediation processes.


## Vendor Assessments

Vendor assessments are crucial processes that organizations use to evaluate the security, reliability, and performance of external entities that provide goods or services. This ensures that all external partners meet the necessary standards to protect organizational interests and data.

### Entities

- **Vendors**
  - Businesses or individuals that provide goods or services to an organization.
  - Evaluate the overall business practices, financial stability, and security measures of vendors.
  - Ensure that vendors comply with relevant industry standards and regulations.

- **Suppliers**
  - Individuals involved in the production and delivery of products or parts of products.
  - Assess the quality of products and services provided by suppliers.
  - Verify that suppliers have reliable processes for production and delivery.

- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**
  - Individuals hired to manage IT services on behalf of the organization.
  - Review the MSPs' capabilities in managing and securing the services they provide.
  - Ensure that MSPs have robust security protocols in place to protect client data and infrastructure.

### Pentesting of Suppliers 

Penetration Testings are simulated cyberattacks against the supplier's system to checked for exploitable vulnerabilities.

- If a vulnerability is found, this could indicate that the supplier's software could be a risk to your systems.
- The goal is to validate the service provider, since their risks could become the company's risks.

### Review the Contracts 

When reviewing the contracts, you should verify that you have the **right to audit clause** included in the contract. This will grant your organization the right to evaluate vendor's internal processes and ensure that they're in compliance with the agreed upon standards.

- Could include the right to audit the data handling, storage, and protection practices of the vendor.
- Not about the lack of trust, but to ensure transparency and that vendors adhere to best practices.

### Internal Audit 

Vendor's self-assessment where they evaluate their own practices againsts industry standards or organizational requirements.

- Vendors can present evidence of consistent and comprehensive internal audits.
- These can serve as a testament to their commitment to security and quality.

### Independent Assessment 

Independent Assessments are evaluations conducted by third-party entities that have no stake in the organization's or vendor's operations.

- Neutral party, ensures vendors adhere to security or performance standards.
- Independent bodies, like ISO.

### Supply Chain Analysis 

Used to dive deep into a vendor's entire supply chain and assess the security and reliability of each link.

- Vendor' security is not just about their practices, but also their entire supply chain's integrity.
- Scrutinize the locations where hardware vendors source their parts.
