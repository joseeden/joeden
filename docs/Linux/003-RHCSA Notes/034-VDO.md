## VDO

VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer) operates as a block device virtualization layer that sits between the file system and physical storage. It optimizes storage by reducing data redundancy and compressing data before it's written to disk.

- Used as a separate volume manager on top of which file systems will be created. 
- Identifies and eliminates duplicate data blocks, reducing storage requirements.
- Compresses data before storage to save disk space.
- Efficiently manages storage allocation, allocating space only as data is written.
- Provides block-level storage optimization, compatible with various file systems.

VDO is implemented through a combination of software (kernel modules and utilities) and hardware capabilities (supporting systems with compatible hardware).

Provides thin-provisioned storage:

- Uses a logical size of 10 times the physical size for VMs and containers. 
- Use a logical size of 3 times the physical size for object storage.



## Lab Setup 

I'm performing this lab on an EC2 instance with multiple EBS volumes attached. I also used this same setup for the Stratis labs. To ensure everything is a fresh new block, we'll need to wipe out the block devices.

```bash
$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  10G  0 disk
├─xvda1 202:1    0   1M  0 part
└─xvda2 202:2    0  10G  0 part /
xvdb    202:16   0  10G  0 disk
```

Remove any existing filesystem and wipe out the block device `xvdb`:

```bash 
wipefs -a /dev/xvdb
blkid -p /dev/xvdb
```


## Installation 

Install the necessary packages and reboot the system:

```bash
sudo yum install -y vdo kmod-kvdo
sudo reboot
```

Enable and start the VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer) service:

```bash
systemctl enable vdo
systemctl start vdo
systemctl status vdo
```

## Create VDO devices

:::info[note]

Ensure underlying block devices are >4GIB 

:::

Create a VDO device named `vdo1` using `/dev/xvdb` with a logical size of 10 terabytes:

```bash
$ vdo create --name=vdo1 --device=/dev/xvdb --vdoLogicalSize=10T
Creating VDO vdo1
      The VDO volume can address 6 GB in 3 data slabs, each 2 GB.
      It can grow to address at most 16 TB of physical storage in 8192 slabs.
      If a larger maximum size might be needed, use bigger slabs.
Starting VDO vdo1
Starting compression on VDO vdo1
VDO instance 0 volume is ready at /dev/mapper/vdo1
```

Format the VDO device `vdo1` with XFS filesystem:

```bash
$ mkfs -t xfs -K /dev/mapper/vdo1
meta-data=/dev/mapper/vdo1       isize=512    agcount=10, agsize=268435455 blks
         =                       sectsz=4096  attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0
         =                       reflink=1
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=2684354550, imaxpct=5
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=521728, version=2
         =                       sectsz=4096  sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
```

Wait for the system to register the new device name:

```bash
udevadm settle
```

Create a mount point for `vdo1`:

```bash
$ mkdir /mnt/diskvdo
$ ll /mnt/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 Jan  2 15:39 diskfs
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 Jan  2 15:33 diskfs2
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 6 Jan  2 16:24 diskvdo
```

Add an entry to `/etc/fstab` for automatic mounting:

```bash
$ vim /etc/fstab

# VDO
/dev/mapper/vdo1                         /mnt/diskvdo             xfs     x-systemd.requires=vdo.service      0 0
```

Mount all filesystems defined in `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
mount -a
```

Verify that `vdo1` is mounted correctly:

```bash
$ mount | grep vdo
/dev/mapper/vdo1 on /mnt/diskvdo type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota,x-systemd.requires=vdo.service)
```


## vdostats

Use `vdostats` to monitor and display statistics related to VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer) volumes.

```bash
$ vdostats
Device               1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Space saving%
/dev/mapper/vdo1      10485760   4202108   6283652  40%           99%
```
```bash
$ vdostats --human-readable
Device                    Size      Used Available Use% Space saving%
/dev/mapper/vdo1         10.0G      4.0G      6.0G  40%           99%
```

## Removing VDO

Before removing a VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer) volume, it's crucial to ensure that the volume is properly unmounted and deactivated to avoid data loss or corruption.

```bash
$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  10G  0 disk
├─xvda1 202:1    0   1M  0 part
└─xvda2 202:2    0  10G  0 part /
xvdb    202:16   0  10G  0 disk
└─vdo1  253:0    0  10T  0 vdo  /mnt/diskvdo
```

Unmount the VDO device:

```bash
umount /mnt/diskvdo
```

Deactivate and remove the VDO device `vdo1`:

```bash
$ vdo deactivate --all
Deactivating VDO vdo1
```

```bash
$ vdo remove --name vdo1
Removing VDO vdo1
Stopping VDO vdo1
```

As an option, we can wipe out the whole block device.

```bash
wipefs -a /dev/xvdb
blkid -p /dev/xvdb
```
