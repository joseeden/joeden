## NIC Naming

Network Interface Card (NIC) naming in Linux can be identified using commands like `ip link` and `ip addr show`. These commands provide information about the state, configuration, and attributes of network interfaces.

![](/img/docs/sv-nic.png)

Sample output: 

```bash
$ ip link

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9001 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 06:57:3b:26:42:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```
```bash
$ ip addr show

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9001 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 06:57:3b:26:42:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.31.33.29/20 brd 172.31.47.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 3065sec preferred_lft 3065sec
    inet6 fe80::457:3bff:fe26:4256/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

## Runtime Configurations

Runtime configurations are temporary settings that are not persistent across reboots. These configurations can be set using the `ip` command to manage and display network interface parameters.

![](/img/docs/sv-runconf-1.png)

Sample output: 

```bash
$ ip link show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9001 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 06:57:3b:26:42:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```
```bash
$ ip -s link show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    RX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped missed  mcast

    40401188   124646   0       0       0       0
```


## DNS

DNS settings are crucial for resolving domain names to IP addresses. Note that every time the network manager restarts, the **resolv.conf** is recreated.

```bash
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Generated by NetworkManager
search ap-southeast-1.compute.internal
nameserver 172.31.0.2
```


## Network Manager

Network Manager is a daemon that manages network connections and configurations. For the majority of RHEL installations, Network Manager is installed by default.

To check if Network Manager is installed:

```bash
$ which NetworkManager

/usr/bin/NetworkManager
```

To check the status: 

```bash
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
```

If it's not installed yet, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y NetworkManager
sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
```

Configuration files for each NIC can be found in the following directory:

```bash
$ ll /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/

total 8
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 244 May  5  2021 ifcfg-ens3
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 159 Nov 29 03:55 ifcfg-eth0
```

To edit configuration files for the NICs, you can use either **nmcli** or **nmtui**, which will interact with the Network Manager to recreate the config files.

![](/img/docs/sv-nic-3.png)


## Network Configuration Files

Network configuration files contain settings for each network interface. These files can be found in the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` directory.

```bash
$ ll /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
total 8
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 244 May  5  2021 ifcfg-ens3
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 159 Nov 29 03:55 ifcfg-eth0
```
```bash
$ cat ifcfg-ens3

TYPE=Ethernet
PROXY_METHOD=none
BROWSER_ONLY=no
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
DEFROUTE=yes
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
NAME=ens3
UUID=14724ada-5aff-43e2-a0f7-c3f3c3f03151

```
```bash 
$ cat ifcfg-eth0
# Created by cloud-init on instance boot automatically, do not edit.
#
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=06:57:3b:26:42:56
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=Ethernet
USERCTL=no
```


## nmcli 

`nmcli` is a command-line client for Network Manager. It allows controlling Network Manager and reporting its status.

![](/img/docs/sv-nmcli.png)


### Install bash-completion

To use `nmcli` efficiently, install the **bash-completion RPM package**. Follow the link [RHEL / CentOS Linux install and activate Bash completion](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/fedora-redhat-scientific-linuxenable-bash-completion/) for instructions.

```bash
sudo yum install -y bash-completion
```

To verify installation:

```bash
$ rpm -qa | grep bash-completion
bash-completion-2.7-5.el8.noarch
```

To activate bash-completion, log out and log back in.


### Using nmcli

Run the following command to interact with Network Manager:

```bash
nmcli
```

To see the status of devices:

```bash
$ nmcli device status

DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION
eth0    ethernet  connected  System eth0
eth1    ethernet  connected  Wired connection 1

IP6.ADDRESS[1]:                         fe80::8c4:b3ff:fe6d:cece/64
```



### Adding a New Address 

To add a new ip address onto a NIC: 

```bash
nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname eth1 con-name eth1
```
```bash
nmcli connection add ifname <interface> \
  ipv4.addresses <ip address> \
  ipv4.gateway <ip-address of gateway> \
  ipv4.dns <ip-address of dns> \
  type <ethernet or wifi>
```

To activate new connection:
 
```bash
nmcli connection up <interface>
```

To see current connections:

```bash
$ nmcli connection show
NAME         UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
System eth0  5fb06bd0-0bb0-7ffb-45f1-d6edd65f3e03  ethernet  eth0
ens3         14724ada-5aff-43e2-a0f7-c3f3c3f03151  ethernet  --
```

To modify an existing connection:

```bash
nmcli connection modify eth1 ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 ipv4.method manual
```

To delete a connection:

```bash
nmcli connection delete eth1
```


### Setting a Static IP

To edit the adapter setting, we can enter an interface prompt in nmcli to change more than one setting. As an example, let's say we will edit eth0. Notice that after you run the command, it will return a new prompt.

```bash
$ sudo nmcli connection edit <adapter-name>

nmcli>
```

To change the settings:

```bash
nmcli> set ipv4.method manual
nmcli> set ipv4.addr 10.0.0.5/24
nmcli> set ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
nmcli> set ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.10
```

To save the settings temporarily (it will not persist after reboot):
 
```bash
nmcli> save temporary
```

To make the changes persistent: 
```bash
nmcli> save persistent
```

To apply the changes, we can reboot.
```bash
reboot
```

We can also restart NetworkManager but note that this will restart your entire network stack. This means even if you change and restart just one adapter, this will restart the rest of the other adapters as well.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworKManager
```

Similarly, the command below also reloads all adapter configurations. But with this command, the adapters doesn't go offline.

```bash
sudo nmcli connection reload
```

The best approach is to reload just the connection we changed.

```bash
sudo nmcli connection down <conn-name>
sudo nmcli connection up <conn-name>
```


## nmtui

`nmtui` is a text user interface for Network Manager, providing a simple and intuitive way to configure network settings from the terminal.

```bash
$ nmtui
```

### Editing a Connection

To edit a connection, use the arrow keys to navigate and select **Edit a connection** > **OK** > select the interface 

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui2.png)

In this case, we want to edit **enp0s3** > **Edit...**

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui3.png)

We want to change the following:

Settings        | old       | new
----------------|-----------|---------
 ipv4 address   | 10.0.2.17 | 10.0.2.15
 gateway        | 10.0.2.4  | 10.0.2.2
 DNS servers    | 8.8.8.8   | 8.8.8.8, 4.4.4.4

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui41.png)

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui42.png)

Go down to the bottom and hit **OK**.

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui43.png)

It will return to the interface page. Hit **Back** to return to the first page.

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui44.png)

To apply the changes, select **Activate a connection** > **OK**

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui45.png)

On the next page, press enter on **Deactivate** to deactivate the connection. Once it changes to **Activate**, press enter to load the connection back up. Hit **Back** afterwards.

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui46.png)

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui47.png)

On the main page, hit **OK** to exit out of nmtui.

![](/img/docs/sv-nmtui48.png)

Verify.

## Testing Network Connections

Testing network connections is essential to ensure proper connectivity and diagnose issues.

![](/img/docs/sv-testing-netconn.png)

### Utilities Not Found

If network utilities such as `dig` and `nslookup` are not found, you can install them using the `bind-utils` package. Follow the instructions in this link: [How Do You Install dig and nslookup on a CentOS/RHEL/Fedora Server?](http://www.continualintegration.com/miscellaneous-articles/how-do-you-install-dig-and-nslookup-on-a-centos-rhel-fedora-server/)

To install `bind-utils`, run:

```bash
sudo yum -y install bind-utils
```

### dig

`dig` is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS).

To query DNS for the domain `google.com`:

```bash
$ dig google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.11.26-RedHat-9.11.26-6.el8 <<>> google.com
;; global options: +cmd

If we query a non-existent domain:

```bash
$ dig jkljjk.kl

; <<>> DiG 9.11.26-RedHat-9.11.26-6.el8 <<>> jkljjk.kl
;; global options: +cmd

Explanation:

- This indicates the version of `dig` being used and the query target (`jkljjk.kl`):

  ```bash
  ; <<>> DiG 9.11.26-RedHat-9.11.26-6.el8 <<>> jkljjk.kl
  ```

- Shows global options set for the `dig` command:

  ```bash
  ;; global options: +cmd
  ```

- Indicates that an answer was received:

  ```bash
  ;; Got answer:
  ```

- This header shows the query type, the status (`NXDOMAIN` meaning non-existent domain), and the unique query ID:

  ```bash
  ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 58161
  ```

- These flags indicate various details about the query and response:

  ```bash
  ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1
  ```

  - `qr`: query response.
  - `rd`: recursion desired.
  - `ra`: recursion available.
  - `QUERY: 1`: One query was made.
  - `ANSWER: 0`: No answers were returned.
  - `AUTHORITY: 1`: One authority record was returned.
  - `ADDITIONAL: 1`: One additional record was returned.

- This section shows the question asked:

  ```bash
  ;; QUESTION SECTION:
  ```

- This is the query asking for the IPv4 address (`A` record) of `jkljjk.kl`:

  ```bash
  ;jkljjk.kl. IN A
  ```

- This section shows the authority section of the response:

  ```bash
  ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
  ```

- This is the Start of Authority (SOA) record for the root domain, indicating that `jkljjk.kl` does not exist:

  ```bash
  . 300 IN SOA a.root-servers.net. nstld.verisign-grs.com. 2021122500 1800 900 604800 86400
  ```

- The query took 53 milliseconds:

  ```bash
  ;; Query time: 53 msec
  ```

- The DNS server used for the query:

  ```bash
  ;; SERVER: 172.31.0.2#53(172.31.0.2)
  ```

- The date and time when the query was made:

  ```bash
  ;; WHEN: Sat Dec 25 16:29:04 PST 2021
  ```

- The size of the response message:

  ```bash
  ;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 113
  ```

## IPTables

**Iptables** is a command-line firewall utility that uses policy chains to allow or block traffic. When a connection tries to establish itself on your system, iptables looks for a rule in its list to match it to. If it doesn’t find one, it resorts to the default action.

iptables almost always comes pre-installed on any Linux distribution. To update/install it, just retrieve the iptables package:

```bash
# Before installing and using iptables services on CentOS and Red Hat 7 systems, its recommended to disable firewalld service.
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo systemctl mask firewalld
sudo systemctl status firewalld

# search for iptables
sudo yum search iptables

# Might need to update
sudo yum update -y

# Install
sudo yum install -y iptables-services
```

After installing, you may now checkout the rules. Note that you have to be **root**.

```bash
$ sudo iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
```

By default, chain policy accepts FORWARDING connections. We can modify this:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -L | grep FORWARD
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
```

To disable, e can change the ACCEPT to DROP: 

```bash 
$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
$ sudo iptables -L | grep FORWARD
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
```

We can also flush the entire iptables rule set. This basically resets/removes rules and IPs.

```bash
sudo iptables --flush
```


### Types of Chains

iptables uses three different chains: input, forward, and output.

- **Input** – This chain is used to control the behavior for incoming connections. For example, if a user attempts to SSH into your PC/server, iptables will attempt to match the IP address and port to a rule in the input chain.

- **Forward** – This chain is used for incoming connections that aren’t actually being delivered locally. Think of a router – data is always being sent to it but rarely actually destined for the router itself; the data is just forwarded to its target. Unless you’re doing some kind of routing, NATing, or something else on your system that requires forwarding, you won’t even use this chain.

- **Output** – This chain is used for outgoing connections. For example, if you try to ping howtogeek.com, iptables will check its output chain to see what the rules are regarding ping and howtogeek.com before making a decision to allow or deny the connection attempt.

### DROP vs. REJECT

To filter incoming ping/ICMP requests from another host/server, use `DROP` or `REJECT` with iptables. This prevents the other server from being able to ping the host.

- **DROP**
  When you use `DROP`, the host will not respond to the requests of the external server. This way, the external server isn't certain if the IP address or interface on the host exists.

  - Adding a DROP rule for ICMP packets on `eth0` interface:
    
    ```bash
    ### " -A INPUT " means add policy
    $ sudo iptables -A INPUT --protocol icmp --in-interface eth0 -j DROP
    ```

  - Verifying the DROP rule:

    ```bash
    $ sudo iptables -L -v | grep DROP
      46  3864 DROP       icmp --  eth0   any     anywhere             anywhere
    ```

  - From an external server trying to ping the host (no reply from host):

    ```bash
    $ ping  172.31.33.29
    PING 172.31.33.29 (172.31.33.29) 56(84) bytes of data.

    ^C
    --- 172.31.33.29 ping statistics ---
    10 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 9217ms
    ```

- **REJECT**
  When you specify `REJECT`, the host will respond to the external server's request by rejecting it.

  - Adding a REJECT rule for ICMP packets on `eth0` interface:

    ```bash
    $ sudo iptables -A INPUT --protocol icmp --in-interface eth0 -j REJECT
    ```

  - Verifying the REJECT rule:

    ```bash
    $ sudo iptables -L -v
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
        0     0 REJECT     icmp --  eth0   any     anywhere             anywhere             reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
    ```

  - From an external server trying to ping the host (host returns "Destination Port Unreachable" error):

    ```bash
    $ ping  172.31.33.29
    PING 172.31.33.29 (172.31.33.29) 56(84) bytes of data.
    From 172.31.33.29 icmp_seq=1 Destination Port Unreachable
    From 172.31.33.29 icmp_seq=2 Destination Port Unreachable
    From 172.31.33.29 icmp_seq=3 Destination Port Unreachable
    From 172.31.33.29 icmp_seq=4 Destination Port Unreachable
    ^C
    --- 172.31.33.29 ping statistics ---
    4 packets transmitted, 0 received, +4 errors, 100% packet loss, time 3057ms
    ```
