## Running Virtual Machines on RHEL

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) provides a robust virtualization platform utilizing several tools that together create a powerful and flexible environment for running virtual machines. These tools include:

### qemu

QEMU (Quick Emulator) is a hardware virtualization and emulation tool. It allows users to create and run virtual machines by emulating hardware components. QEMU is used for tasks requiring moderate performance, such as testing and development environments.

### kvm

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a virtualization module in the Linux kernel that enables the kernel to function as a hypervisor. Unlike QEMU, KVM does not perform hardware emulation. Instead, it allows virtual machines to directly access the hardware of the host system, resulting in near-native performance. KVM is used in high-performance environments where efficient resource utilization is critical.

### libvirt

Libvirt is a collection of software tools, including APIs and command-line utilities, designed to manage virtualized platforms. It provides a unified interface for managing various virtualization technologies, making it easier to create, modify, and monitor virtual machines.

### OpenShift

Additionally, Red Hat offers **OpenShift**, a platform that integrates these tools to manage both virtual machines and containers. OpenShift is a commercially supported product that enhances the capabilities of the underlying virtualization technologies.

## Not Installed by Default 

In a standard RHEL installation, the virtualization clients are included, but the full virtualization platform is not installed by default. 

### Installation 

To set up the required tools for virtualization, follow these steps:

First, install the necessary packages using the `dnf` package manager:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y qemu-kvm qemu-img libvirt virt-manager virt-install
```

After installation, you need to start the libvirt daemon (`libvirtd`), which will manage the QEMU and KVM processes. Enable the service to start at boot and start it immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
```

Check the status of the libvirtd service to ensure it is running correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
```

### Graphical User Interface

RHEL provides two graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for managing virtual machines:

- **GNOME Boxes**
  GNOME Boxes is a user-friendly interface for creating and managing virtual machines. It is designed for desktop users who need a simple way to set up virtual environments.

- **VirtManager**
  VirtManager is a more advanced GUI for managing virtual machines. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for configuring and monitoring virtual environments, making it suitable for system administrators and power users.

### Command-Line Interface 

For users who prefer or require command-line tools, RHEL offers `virt-install`, a command-line utility for creating virtual machines. Here is an example command to create a virtual machine:

```bash
virt-install \
--name=webserver01 \
--ram=1024 \
--vcpus=1 \
--location=/var/lib/libvirt//img/docs/rhel-8.1-x86_64-dvd.iso \
--os-variant=rhel8 \
--graphics spice \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt//img/docs/webserver01.dsk,size=20 \
--extra-args='console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial'
```
