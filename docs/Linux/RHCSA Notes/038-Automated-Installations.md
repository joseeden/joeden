Automated installations help streamline the deployment process by using predefined configurations, making it easier to manage and maintain multiple systems.

## Creating a Kickstart File

Kickstart files automate the installation of Red Hat-based systems by providing predefined answers to installation questions.

To list existing kickstart files:

```bash
$ ll *.cfg
-rw-------. 1 root root 7194 May  4  2021 anaconda-ks.cfg
-rw-------. 1 root root 6940 May  4  2021 original-ks.cfg
```

The parameters used when booting the system can be found in the **anaconda-ks.cfg** file. Alternatively, you can use [Red Hat's Kickstart Generator](https://access.redhat.com/labsinfo/kickstartconfig) to create the kickstart configuration files.


## ksvalidator

`ksvalidator` is a tool to check the syntax of your kickstart file. Note that it needs to be installed separately.

To install `ksvalidator`:

```bash
sudo yum install pykickstart -y
```

After installation, use the `ksvalidator` command followed by the kickstart file to validate it:

```bash
ksvalidator ./name-of-kickstart.cfg 
``` 


## Automatic Installations

After modifying the kickstart file, you need to instruct the system to use it during the installation process.

During bootup, select the **Install** option and press the Tab key. This will prompt a command line at the bottom where you can provide the link to the kickstart file.

## Fully Automated Datacenters

In a fully automated datacenter setup, an install-server hosts all the necessary files for automation and runs a DHCP server connected to a TFTP server.

The automated installation process involves:

1. On the servers, initiate a **pxeboot**, prompting the server to reach out to the install-server-host.
2. The host sends a boot image to the server.
3. The server uses the boot image to load the configuration file and reaches out again to the host to get the kickstart file.
4. The host sends the kickstart file, and the server begins the installation.

## Using Vagrant to Set up VMs

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. It provides a simple way to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.
